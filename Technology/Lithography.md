## Lithography

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithography

Lithography (from Ancient Greek λίθος, lithos, meaning 'stone', and γράφειν, graphein, meaning 'to write') is a method of printing originally based on the immiscibility of oil and water. The printing is from a stone (lithographic limestone) or a metal plate with a smooth surface. It was invented in 1796 by German author and actor Alois Senefelder as a cheap method of publishing theatrical works. Lithography can be used to print text or artwork onto paper or other suitable material.

Lithography originally used an image drawn with oil, fat, or wax onto the surface of a smooth, level lithographic limestone plate. The stone was treated with a mixture of acid and gum arabic, etching the portions of the stone that were not protected by the grease-based image. When the stone was subsequently moistened, these etched areas retained water; an oil-based ink could then be applied and would be repelled by the water, sticking only to the original drawing. The ink would finally be transferred to a blank paper sheet, producing a printed page. This traditional technique is still used in some fine art printmaking applications.

Lithography works because of the mutual repulsion of oil and water.

**Chromolithography** 

- 1837 

is a unique method for making multi-colour prints. This type of colour printing stemmed from the process of lithography, and includes all types of lithography that are printed in colour. When chromolithography is used to reproduce photographs, the term photochrome is frequently used.

**Tinplate Lithography**

In the late 19th century it was discovered that very thin metal plates could be substituted for the stones, and since they only weighed a few pounds or even less, they were easy to handle and no storage problem. Although commercial printers no longer used stones, the term "lithograph" stuck. With the lightweight metal plates, high-speed presses could be used, and they did beautiful work on paper. But printing on very hard flat surfaces like tin was still an unsatisfactory process.

**Offset Lithography**

In the early 20th century several American printers figured out how to do it. If the printer rolls a very large rubber roller over the printing plate the image transfers beautifully to the rubber surface. If the roller is then rolled over paper, cardboard, tin, or even glass the image "offsets" (transfers) from the roller to the paper or tin beautifully. The transfer of ink from the plate to the rubber roller and then to the paper or tin is called "offset lithography". This is what is used on tin litho toys.
