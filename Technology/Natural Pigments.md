Iron oxide pigments, which may be natural or synthetic, have been used as colorants since early humans began painting on cave walls. Natural pigments are derived from several iron oxide minerals: 

Red pigments are derived from hematite.

Yellow and brown pigments — ochres, sierras and umbers — are derived from limonite, an iron ore consisting of a mixture of hydrated iron(III) oxide-hydroxides in varying composition.

Magnetite provides a black iron oxide pigment. 

Micaceous iron oxide is a special form of hematite that occurs in thin metallic gray platelets or flakes.

**Charcoal**

Carbon black was used as a pigment since very earliest times.  Carbon blacks are made by heating wood, or other plant material, with a very restricted air supply. Sticks of charcoal have been used for sketching by artists of all periods, and traces of their work may be found on the ground layer of paintings. Carbon black was used both in oil and watercolour. Carbon black is used today in photocopier and laser printer toner.Carbon black is easy to prepare and has excellent hiding power.
