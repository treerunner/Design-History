Cai Lun (Chinese: 蔡伦; c. 57–62 – 121 CE), formerly romanized as Ts'ai Lun, courtesy name Jingzhong (敬仲), was a Chinese inventor and eunuch court official of the Han dynasty. He is traditionally regarded as the inventor of paper and the papermaking process, for he originated paper in its modern form. Although early forms of paper had existed in China since the 2nd century BCE, he was responsible for significant improvements and standardization of papermaking by adding important new materials into its composition.

In 105 CE, Cai Lun publicly declared that he had invented a new composition for paper and papermaking process. Writing had a long history in China with substitutes for paper originally being wood for short text and bamboo for lengthy text. These alternatives were inconvenient for many reasons, being especially awkward to store, heavy and difficult to write on. With the introduction of a writing animal-hair brush by Meng Tian in the third century BCE, silk and cloth became alternatives that addressed these issues, but their high cost prevented widespread use. The absence of a practical solution motivated continued experimentation with different materials; Cai's pulp solution became the most widely used in 105 CE.  Cai's process still involved the use of bamboo but also hemp waste, old rags, fishnets and most importantly, bark from trees, probably mulberry. These materials were boiled in a pulp that was beaten with a wood or stone mallet and then mixed with a large amount of water. Then an unknown ingredient to bond the fiber together was added and the excess water was removed, leaving the paper finished after drying

Of China's so-called Four Great Inventions – the compass, gunpowder, papermaking and printing – Cai Lun is the only originator of one of these whose name has not been lost to history.
