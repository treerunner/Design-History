- 1968: Digital Typography
- The first digital typeface—**Digi Grotesk**—was designed by Rudolf Hell in 1968. Early digital fonts were bitmaps, which resulted in less-than-ideal readability at small sizes. In 1974, the first outline (vector) fonts were developed, which resulted in better readability at the same time as reducing file sizes.

Futureworld Animation, 1976

<hr>

- 3D computer graphics use a three-dimensional representation of geometric data that is stored in the computer for the purposes of performing calculations and rendering 2D images. 
- Such images may be stored for viewing later or displayed in real-time. 
- 3D computer graphics rely on many of the same algorithms as 2D computer vector graphics in the wire-frame model and 2D computer raster graphics in the final rendered display
- 3D computer graphics software began appearing for home computers in the late 1970s. 
- The earliest known example is _3D Art Graphics_, a set of 3D computer graphics effects, written by Kazumasa Mitazawa and released in June 1978 for the Apple II
- William Fetter was credited with coining the term _computer graphics_ in 1961 to describe his work at Boeing
- One of the first displays of computer animation was _Futureworld_ (1976), which included an animation of a human face and a hand that had originally appeared in the 1972 experimental short _A Computer Animated Hand_, created by University of Utah students Edwin Catmulland Fred Parke.

### The Internet

- 1990: WorldWideWeb 
- At CERN, a Swiss research center, a British physicist and internet pioneer **Tim Berners-Lee** created the world's first web browser, called **WorldWideWeb**. The browser was also a simple WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor for editing web pages. WorldWideWeb only worked with the NeXTStep operating system. Later, the browser was renamed Nexus to avoid confusion with the World Wide Web (WWW).

![[worldwideweb-the-first-browser.png]]

- 1991: Gopher
- **Gopher system** was created at the University of Minnesota as a text-based system that used the hierarchical menu structure for navigation. It was a system working on a client-server basis. **Gopher integrated the services of FTP, Usenet, Veronica, Archie and WAIS**. Since 1996, Gopher has been on a decline and is currently used very rarely.

![[gopher.png]]

- 1991: First Website. 
- The World Wide Web (WWW) creator, **Tim Berners-Lee** launched the world's first website at [**http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html**](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html). Unfortunately, the original website has not been preserved until today and the link shows only its 1992 copy.

![[the-first-website.png]]

- 1991: HTML Tags and HTTP. 
- The **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** is an Internet protocol designed to exchange hypertext documents (images, websites, etc.) between the server and the web browser. The first protocol design, later called **HTTP v0.9**, was created by Tim Berners-Lee as part of the WWW service specification. The HTTP v0.9 version was extremely simple, using only the GET method with one parameter, i.e. the name of the requested document.

- 1992: First image on the WorldWideWeb. 
- Silvano de Gennaro, an Italian computer scientist who worked at CERN research labs, was asked by Tim Berners-Lee to scan and upload a photo of a parody pop-group called **Les Horribles Cernettes** (The Horrible CERN Girls) onto the info.cern.ch website. **This photo became one of the first images to be published on the World Wide Web.**

![[les-horribles-cernettes.png]]

- 1994: Yahoo! 
- **Jerry Yang** and **David Filo**, two Ph.D. students from Stanford University, created a list of websites entitled "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web." In March 1994, the portal was renamed **Yahoo!** and the yahoo.com domain was registered on January 18, 1995. **Yahoo is an acronym for “Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle”.** In March 1995, the Yahoo! search engine was launched as part of the portal.

Clicking on the banner led to a virtual tour of world galleries and museums.

- 1995: Batman Forever. Commercial Website
- Three web designers - **Jeffrey Zeldman**, **Steve McCarron** and **Alec Pollak** \- created an official website for **Batman Forever**. At the time, it was one of the first web projects that used the WWW service as a marketing and visual medium.

![[batman-forever-website-1995.png]]

- 1995: Amazon
- Amazon, founded by **Jeff Bezos**, launched one of the first online stores on **Amazon.com on July 5, 1994**. Amazon first began as an online bookstore and later expanded its range of products to CDs, DVDs, software, clothes, toys, etc. In 1998, Amazon purchased the **Internet Movie Database (IMDb)**, and, a year later, the **Alexa.com** web service. In 2002, Amazon started running a cloud platform called **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, and as of November 2007, the **Amazon Kindle e-reader** belongs to one of its major products.

- 1996: Adobe (Macromedia Flash)
- In December 1996, Macromedia acquired FutureWave Software, which was developing the **FutureSplash animator**. The program was used to create vector animations that could be played with the FutureSplash Viewer plugin in the then popular Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer. In December 18th 1996, Macromedia released an enhanced version of this program called **Macromedia Flash 1.0**.

- 1998: Design is Kinky
- **Design is Kinky**, founded by Andrew Johnstone, was **one of the first design community websites**. The website regularly presents graphic works, photographs, expert articles or profiles of artists who have decided to publish their work online. In 2018, the project Design is Kinky terminated its activity.

![[design-is-kinky-2001.png]]

- 1998: Google
- A pair of Ph.D. students from Stanford University, **Larry Page** and **Sergey Brin**, created the **Google search engine**. Google originally started as a research project whose aim was to find relevant search results using a mathematical algorithm. The algorithm, later called **PageRank**, analyzed relationships between individual webpages based on their cross-references, thus assessing their importance. The name Google is a deliberate misspelling of the word **googol**, which refers to a very high number – 1 followed by a hundred zeros (10100).

![[google-november-1998.png]]

- 1998: K10K
- Two Danish web designers, Michael Schmidt and Toke Nygaard, launched a community website for designers, called **Kaliber10000 (K10k)**. The K10k webzine published graphical works of talented designers on a regular basis and became an important source of inspiration for the first generation of designers who started using the web as a visual medium. In October 2011, K10k terminated its activity.

- **Jimmy Wales** and **Larry Sanger** founded **Wikipedia**, a multilingual internet encyclopedia. The content of the encyclopedia is shared under a free and open license of the **Creative Commons**. Volunteer contributors from around the world participate in the creation of Wikipedia entries. Wikipedia’s precursor was the Nupedia web encyclopedia, to which, unlike Wikipedia, only experts were allowed to contribute. At the beginning of 2018, Wikipedia contained articles written in nearly 300 languages.

- 2003: MySpace
- Tom Anderson and Chris DeWolfe founded the **MySpace social network**. Its concept was inspired by the then popular social network called Friendster. MySpace popularity skyrocketed, and by February 2004, the network had acquired one million users. **Between 2004 and 2010, MySpace was one of the largest social networks worldwide**. In April 2008, however, the number of unique monthly users was surpassed by Facebook, and since then the popularity of MySpace has been on a continuous decline.

![[myspace-2003.png]]

- 2005: YouTube
- Three former PayPal employees, **Chad Hurley**, **Steve Chen** and **Jawed Karim**, launched the **YouTube** website for publishing and sharing video files. **The first video called "Me at the zoo" was uploaded to YouTube on 23 April, 2005** by one of the co-founders, Jawed Karim.
