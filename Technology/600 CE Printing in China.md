## 600 CE Printing in China

Printing was invented in China during the Tang Dynasty (618-906 AD). The first mentioning of printing is an imperial decree from 593 AD, in which the Sui Emperor Wen-ti orders Buddhist images and scriptures to be printed.

The earliest form of Chinese printing relied on blocks cut from wood. These blocks were used to print textiles and reproduce Buddhist texts. Short religious texts printed in this fashion was carried as charms.

How early Chinese woodblock printing was done:

First, the text was written on a piece of paper.

The paper was glued face down onto a wooden plate.

With the written characters as a guide, characters were carved out to make a wood-block printing plate.

The wood-block printing plate was used to print. An expert printer could print 2,000 or more sheets per day from one plate.
