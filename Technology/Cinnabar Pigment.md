## Cinnabar Pigment

Cinnabar or cinnabarite, likely deriving from the Ancient Greek: κιννάβαρι is the bright scarlet to brick-red form of mercury(II) sulfide (HgS). It is the most common source ore for refining elemental mercury, and is the historic source for the brilliant red or scarlet pigment termed vermilion and associated red mercury pigments.

Cinnabar has been used for its color since antiquity in the Near East, including as a rouge-type cosmetic, in the New World since the Olmec culture, and in China for writing on Oracle bones as early as the Zhou dynasty. Later in the Song dynasty it was used in coloring lacquerware.
