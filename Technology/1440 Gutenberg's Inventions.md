### Printing Press

Gutenberg built off the work of others to incorporate movable type with a screw press.

 - Modeled on the design of existing screw presses
 - could produce up to 3,600 pages per workday
 - rapid creation of metal movable type in large quantities. 
 - drastically reduced the cost of printing books and other documents in Europe

From Mainz the printing press spread within several decades to over two hundred cities in a dozen European countries

- 1500, printing presses in operation throughout Western Europe had already produced more than twenty million volumes
- In the 16th century, with presses spreading further afield, their output rose tenfold to an estimated 150 to 200 million copies 
- The operation of a press became synonymous with the enterprise of printing, and lent its name to a new medium of expression and communication, "the press".
