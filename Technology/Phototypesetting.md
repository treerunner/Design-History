- Phototypesetting is a method of setting type that uses a photographic process to generate columns of type on a scroll of photographic paper
- rendered obsolete with the popularity of the personal computer and desktop publishing software

**Process**

Phototypesetters quickly project light through a film negative image of an individual character in a font through a lens that magnifies or reduces the size of the character onto photographic paper, which is then collected on a spool in a light-proof canister. 

The photographic paper or film is then fed into a processor—a machine that pulls the paper or film strip through two or three baths of chemicals—where it emerges ready for paste-up or film make-up. Later phototypesetting machines used alternative methods, such as displaying a digitised character on a CRT screen.

**Advantages**

- no need to keep heavy metal type and matrices in stock
- the ability to use a much wider range of fonts and graphics and print them at any desired size
- faster page layout setting
