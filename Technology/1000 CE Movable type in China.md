Movable type was invented in the 1040s by a commoner named Pi Sheng. Instead of carving a unique wood-block plate for each page in a book, he used movable Chinese characters that could be fastened on a plate, used for printing, removed, and fastened again in new spots on the plate to create a new text.

Each of Pi Shengâ€™s movable types had one Chinese character on it, carved in relief on a small block. The character was carved into moistened clay, and the type was then hardened by fire to make it more durable.

The plate used was made from iron, and a removable resin-based glue was used to glue on the types prior to printing.

For many centuries, wood-block printing and movable type printing existed side by side in China.

Due to the number of characters in the writing system movable type was never widely adopetd in the East

Chinese technology for printing slowly made its way West by the time of the Renaissance
