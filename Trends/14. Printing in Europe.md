### Typography & Politics (religion?)

Propaganda during the Reformation, helped by the spread of the printing press throughout Europe and in particular within Germany, caused new ideas, thoughts, and doctrine to be made available to the public in ways that had never been seen before the sixteenth century. 

Martin Luther's broadsides against the Catholic church.

Passional Christi und Antichristi

https://www.wga.hu/html_m/c/cranach/lucas_e/16/57woodcu.html

During the Reformation, Lutheran artists in Wittenberg and Nuremberg anonymously produced dozens of broadsheets and pamphlets satirizing the pope, clergy and many Catholic beliefs. Lucas Cranach illustrated and Philip Melanchthon supplied the text for a small picture book (Passional Christi und Antichristi, Wittenberg, 1521) comparing the passion of Christ with that of the Antichrist, the pope. Using visual antithesis, thirteen pair of woodcuts clearly distinguish their respective behaviour.

### The Printing Scene in Italy

**Swenhym and Pannartz**

- Arnold Pannartz and Konrad Sweynheim were printers from Mainz, Germany.
- 1464: Invited to Benedictine Abbey in Subiaco Italy to establish a printing press.

Innovation: A move towards Roman caps paired with caroline miuscule to create "double alphabet"

![[Roman_typeface_Sweynheym_and_Pannartz_1465.png]]

The Benedictine abbey of Subiaco was the cradle of Italian printing. Probably Cardinal Giovanni of Turrecremata, who was Abbot in commendam of Subiaco, summoned the two printers there. They came in 1464. The first book that they printed at Subiaco was a Donatus; it has not, however, been preserved. The first book printed in Italy that is extant was a Cicero, De oratore (now in the Buchgewerbehaus at Leipzig), issued in September, 1465. It was followed by Lactantius, De divinis institutionibus, in October, 1465, and Augustine's De civitate Dei (1467). These four impressions from Subiaco are of particular importance, because they *abandon the Blackletter of the early German books*.

Supported by Pope Sixtus IV who was very interested in printing.
