Screen from film *Helvetica*

- developed to transcend the preference by swiss designers for Akzidenz Grotesk (AG Berthold, Germany)
- a matter of business and national pride
- quickly adopted by many Swiss designers (with the exception of Emil Ruder who preferred Univers)

**Characteristics**

![[Neue_Haas_Grotesk-alphabet.png]]

- consistently horizontal stroke terminals
- extremely tight spacing
- dense and vigorous texture
- Tall x-height, which makes it easier to read at distance.
- An oblique rather than italic style, a common feature of almost all grotesque and neo-grotesque typefaces.
- Wide capitals of uniform width, particularly obvious in the wide 'E' and 'F'.
- Square-looking 's'.
- Bracketed top flag of '1'.
- Rounded off square tail of 'R'.
- Concave curved stem of '7'.
- Two-storied 'a' (with curves of bowl and stem), a standard neo-grotesque feature, and single-storey 'g'

*Neutrality? Complicity?*

**Timeline of Helvetica**

<hr>

- 1927 the German foundry D. Stempel GmbH acquired a partial interest in the Haas Type Foundry
- mid-1950s, the Haas typefoundry in Switzerland recognized a decrease in sales of their grotesk typefaces
- Designs were less favored than competitors like Berthold’s Akzidenz-Grotesk
- Eduard Hoffmann (president of Haas), saw an opportunity and commissioned former Haas salesman and designer, Max Miedinger, to design a new Haas Grotesk.
- goal of developing a new face to be used in Linotype machines
- Work on Neue Haas Grotesk began early in the fall of 1956
- Miedinger and Hoffmann exchanged drawings, proofs, and comparisons with the old grotesks.
- debut at the “Graphic 57” trade show in June 1957

Eduard Hoffman's scrapbook

- quickly became a hallmark of contemporary Swiss graphic design
- June 1959 Hoffmann made a deal with D. Stempel AG in Germany to manufacture Neue Haas Grotesk for the Linotype machine
- The name “Neue Haas Grotesk” was deemed less than ideal for an international Linotype market
- Heinz Eul, sales manager at Stempel, suggested “Helvetia”, which is Latin for “Switzerland”, but Hoffmann was not convinced, especially since a sewing machine manufacturer and insurance company already carried the name. He instead suggested “Helvetica” – “the Swiss”.
- Linotype version renamed Helvetica
- Hand set version remained New Haas Grotesk
- immediate success created a demand for a more robust family
- Linotype versions lost a little bit of the original character of the face
- Photo typesetting versions were developed later as well
- coarse 18-unit width system used in the phototype era

**Digital Era**

- Helvetica was among the first typefaces to be adapted for digital typesetting
- Helvetica developed early on for use in Macintosh computers. 
- 1982 Linotype set out to revise and systematize the hodgepodge of fonts Helvetica had become over years
- Adopted a numeric naming system from Univers
- 2004 Christian Schwartz was commissioned to digitize Neue Haas Grotesk - a revival of sorts
- released in 2010
- much fidelity to the original shapes and spacing as possible”, he carefully redrew the typeface to match Miedinger’s original forms

**Paula Scher on Helvetica:**

“The corporate culture was the visual language of big corporations, and at that time they were persuasively Helvetica. And they looked alike. They looked a little fascistic to me. They were clean. They reminded me of cleaning your room. I felt like it was some conspiracy of my mother’s to make me keep the house clean, that all that my messy room adolescent rebellion was coming back at me in the form of Helvetica and that I had to over throw it."

"I was also morally opposed to Helvetica because I viewed the big corporations that were slathered in Helvetica as sponsors of the Vietnam War. So therefore if you used Helvetica you were in favor of the Vietnam War so how could you use it?”

– Paula Scher, appearing in Hustwit's documentary, *Helvetica*

"You can say, "I love you," in Helvetica. And you can say it with Helvetica Extra Light if you want to be really fancy. Or you can say it with the Extra Bold if it's really intensive and passionate, you know, and it might work."
– Massimo Vignelli in *Helvetica*
