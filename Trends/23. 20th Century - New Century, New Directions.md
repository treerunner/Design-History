## 20th Century: A New Century, New Directions

Turn of a century "invites introspection."

Neo-classical revival in architecture

Art nouveau challenges Victorian convention:

- New forms as a viable approach
- Abstract 
- Symbolic
- minimalism
- Reduction

Trend toward:
Streamlining > Reduction > Removal of ornament through the early 20th C.

**Frank Lloyd Wright**

- 1867 - 1959
- Trending away from organic curves to rectilinear spatial organization
- Rejected historicism for a philosophy of "organic architecture"

Away from the facade to the interior: "something which the part is to the whole as the whole is to the part, and which is all devoted to a purpose"

- Purposeful architecture
- Space as essence of design

Early Frank Lloyd Wright Graphic Design: *The House Beautiful*, 

- 1896-1897
- by William Gannett, clergy person and social reformer
- 90 copies, hand printed

In his popular “The House Beautiful” essay, Gannett describes how simplicity and craftsmanship are key in creating both a home and a marriage. The essay’s sentiment resonated deeply with members of the Arts and Crafts movement in the United States, including Wright.

“It was a charming thing,” Wright said of Gannett’s essay in a 1955 talk to the Taliesin Fellowship, “it charmed me, and so I suggested we print it.”

### The Vienna Secession

![[secession_monograms.jpg]]

The Vienna Secession evolved to be a counter movement to floral art nouveau.

Evolution in form from illustrative/allegorical style into doing away with ornament / space consiousness.

- Communal Aesthetic
- Move toward geometric away from flowing line

**Koloman Moser**

- 1868 - 1918
- Austrian artist
- exerted considerable influence on twentieth-century graphic art
- one of the foremost artists of the Vienna Secession movement
- co-founder of Wiener Werkstätte.

Moser's designs in architecture, furniture, jewellery, graphics, and tapestries helped characterize the work of this era. He drew upon the clean lines and repetitive motifs of classical Greek and Roman art and architecture in reaction to the Baroque decadence of his turn-of-the-century Viennese surroundings.

### Alfred Loos

- Essay: Ornament and Crime
- 1908
- Written when Art Nouveau—known as Secession in Austria and which Loos had excoriated even at its height in 1900—was showing a new way forward for modern art. 
- articulated moralizing views, inherited from the Arts and Crafts movement
- fundamental to the Bauhaus design studio
- helped define the ideology of modernism in architecture and design

"The evolution of culture marches with the elimination of ornament from useful objects"

- Ornamentation is trendy, surface level, - not timeless.
- Decorative details were for degenerates
- Loos believed real design should be strong and stolid and stripped-back

The reader does not look at forms - only the rhythm.

**Behrens Grid System**

- 1903 - Behrens as director of Dusseldorf School of Arts and Crafts
- 1904 - influenced by architect JL Mathieu Lauwerik's grid system for total design.

Lauwerik's layouts often presented a circle perfectly fit within a proportional square. This could be built upon by subdividing and then again duplicating its structure. This basic building block because a staple in organizational structure towards many different types of design including graphic and industrial. Lauwerik's designs soon filtered into the twentieth century design when we started to see more rational geometry be used in works to establish a organized structure in the base of design. “It is his assumption that the pattern of cosmic order is manifest in architecture, and that behind that cosmic oder lies a creative mathematics”

**Deutsch Werkbund **

- 1907
- German Association of Craftsmen
- Union of art with technology
- influenced but different from Arts and Crafts:

"While Morris was repulsed by the products of the machine age and advocated for a return to medieval craftsmanship, in romantic protest against the industrial revolution, the Werkbund recognized the value of machines and advocated design as a way to give form and meaning to all machine made things, including buildings."

"Gesamkultur" - universal culture in a man made environment.

2 Factions in Werkbund:

1. Standardization and maximization of mechanical manufacturing. Artist takes a back seat.
2. Primacy of individual expression over mechanization.

Behrens was in the middle theoretically but leaned toward 1 in practice.

**AEG Turbine Hall 1909**

![[Berlin_AEG_Turbinenfabrik.jpg]]

Behrens design referenced the neo-classical, with metal strapping on the piers of the gable end either side creating a rusticated appearance. David Watkin describes it as a "temple of power". Similarly, Tom Wilkinson likens it to an "up-to-date edition of the Parthenon".

Factory design at that time was either unpretentious steel and glass, or a "crenellated castle-cities" with a dowdy coat of historicist design, hiding the technology within. Peter Behrens created an architecture for industry that came out of hiding behind historicist facades for the first time, transformed by a new self-confidence, creating a suitably impressive and sophisticated image for the public face of the Moabit industrial site.
