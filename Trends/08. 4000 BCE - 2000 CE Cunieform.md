## 4000 BCE - 2000 CE Cunieform

Cuneiform was one of the earliest systems of writing, invented by Sumerians in ancient Mesopotamia. It is distinguished by its wedge-shaped marks on clay tablets, made by means of a blunt reed for a stylus. The term cuneiform comes from cuneus, Latin for "wedge".

Emerging in Sumer in the late fourth millennium BC (the Uruk IV period) to convey the Sumerian language, which was a language isolate, cuneiform writing began as a system of pictograms, stemming from an earlier system of shaped tokens used for accounting. In the third millennium, the pictorial representations became simplified and more abstract as the number of characters in use decreased (Hittite cuneiform). The system consists of a combination of logophonetic, consonantal alphabetic and syllabic signs.

**logophonetic**

Logophonetic scripts contain two main types of signs. One category of signs are those that indicate morphemes, or the smallest units within a language that carry grammatical significance. The other type of sign represents a sound. In most logophonetic systems, their phonetic signs usually represent syllables.

**consonantal alphabetic**

Consonantal alphabets all developed from the Proto-Sinaitic script, which was the first alphabetic writing system. A pure consonantal alphabet will contain no vowels, although there are many alphabets that are considered to be consonantal which do contain a few vowels . Arabic and Hebrew are consonantal based.

**syllabic signs.**

a set of written symbols that represent (or approximate) syllables

Cuneiform evolved toward abstraction and efficiency. Grid and columns were utilized. 

Cuneiform advanced toward rebus writing

Cnueiform was a vernacular writing system that was not overly formalized. At it's peak it had over 560 signs - many regional variants.

A special industry of scribes was advanced - people schooled in tablets at the edubba (tablet house).

**Rebus:**

A rebus is a device that combines the use of illustrated pictures with individual letters to depict words or phrases. For example:
