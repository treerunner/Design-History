- 1954 the type foundry Deberny & Peignot wanted to add a linear sans serif antiqua in serveral weights to the range of the Lumitype-fonts
-  Adrian Frutiger suggested refraining from adapting an existing alphabet and instead to develop a new font that would, above all, be suitable for the typesetting of longer texts
-  The result, Univers, was published in 1957 (same year as Helvetica)
-  Univers was the first typeface released simultaneously as hand-set type, Monotype hot type, and phototype, bridging all the technological advances that had developed over the history of typesetting up to that date
-  twenty-one width and weight variations of "Univers" were created 
-  an innovative numbering system that identified each characteristic
-  dispensed with historical names, such as "bold" and "extra bold.

### Characteristics

- neo-grotesque sans-serif typeface
- based on Akzidenz-Grotesk
- released after a long period in which geometric typefaces such as Futura had been popular
- Frutiger disliked purely geometric designs, finding them too rigid
- based on 19th-century grotesques

- Frutiger described Univers in 1998 as having a 'visual sensitivity between thick and thin' strokes, avoiding perfect geometry
- Different weights and variations within the type family are designated by the use of numbers instead of names
- slanted form is an oblique (same glyph but slanted, not italics) - 12 degrees in Univers
- ampersand is an 'et' ligature

Compared to other neo-grotesks:

-   The tail of 'a' and the top of '1' are much less rounded.
-   Upper-case 'G' is formed without an arrow head (called a _spur_).
-   Both arms of 'K' join at the stem.
-   The tail of 'Q' runs along the baseline.
-   The tail of 'R' is curved (compared with Akzidenz-Grotesk).
-   The top of 't' is angled.
-   The dot of the 'i' is not square but a rectangle.
-   Lower-case 'y' has a straight descender.
-   Many of the numerals in Univers have straight vs. curved ascenders
-   Helvetica tends to have a slightly greater x-height than Univers
-   Univers generally has quite a wide spacing between letters, and its low x-height gives it a more low-slung, splayed appearance than Helvetica, especially in bold.

"Helvetica is the jeans, and Univers the dinner jacket."
– Adrian Frutiger
