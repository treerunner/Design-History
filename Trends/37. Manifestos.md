Symbolist Manifesto - 1886
Jean Moréas
https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/French/MoreasManifesto.php

"..the impressionist will build upon his work of subjective deformation, fortified by this axiom: that art can only find in the objective a simple, and extremely limited, point of departure."

Futurist Manisfesto 1909
Filippo Thommaso Marinetti

"We declare that the splendor of the world has been enriched by a new beauty: the beauty of speed. A racing automobile with its bonnet adorned with great tubes like serpents with explosive breath ... a roaring motor car which seems to run on machine-gun fire, is more beautiful than the Victory of Samothrace."

"Intuitive feeling is now becoming conscious, not longer is it subconscious.."

"The square is not a subconscious form. It is the creation of intuitive reason. It is the face of the new art. The square is a living, royal infant. It is the first step of pure creation in art. Before it, there were naive deformities and copies of nature."

Constructivism Manifesto 
Alexei Gan - 1922
https://literarymovementsmanifesto.wordpress.com/more/alexei-gan-excerpt-from-constructivism-1922/

"Let us tear ourselves away from our speculative activity \[art\] and find the way to real work, applying our knowledge and skills to real, live and expedient work."

"Our Constructivism has declared unconditional war on art, for the means and qualities of art are not able to systematize the feelings of a revolutionary environment."

First Surrealist Manifesto - 1924
André Breton

"SURREALISM, _n._ Psychic automatism in its pure state, by which one proposes to express -- verbally, by means of the written word, or in any other manner -- the actual functioning of thought. Dictated by the thought, in the absence of any control exercised by reason, exempt from any aesthetic or moral concern."
