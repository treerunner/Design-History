## IBM

From 1956 to 1991, Paul Rand signed the identity of one of the largest corporate design projects in North American history: IBM (International Business Machines Corporation). 

This was the very beginning of corporate graphic identities (in the US). Companies like IBM and CCA, to name a few, set out to gain trust of the consumer - and to put a face on internationalist corporations that would set them apart. Presenting a modernist and innovative image was obvious.

IBM's new design mission - supported by Thomas Watson Jr., the son of the company's founder - visually transformed every aspect of the company, from electric typewriters to computers, advertising and architecture. The idea was to break with a conservative image and look towards the future, to illustrate IBM's renewed growth. Watson called on Eliot Noyes, a former colleague and architect who worked on curative design of the MoMa, among other things, to set up a team composed of:

Under Eliot Noyes, IBM went from:

### Paul Rand's Designs for IBM

IBM's new identity is thus conceived as a global, moving, immediately recognizable work of art delivering a strong message. With design as the main driving force. Charles Eames pointed out, "design is a plan for arranging elements in such a way as best to accomplish a particular purpose.".

Rand designed a modern logo with bright colours coming to life on stationery, brochures, packaging and buildings. It was a major break with the graphics that IBM had been displaying since its origins, post-World War I, and the repeated inconsistencies of their communication campaigns. Paul Rand unified IBM's visual identity, helping it to be recognized by the public as a great company at the forefront of technology (and anything but communist, that goes without saying).
