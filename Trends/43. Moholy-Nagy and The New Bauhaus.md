EM 2 (Telephone Picture)
Porceline enamel on steel - 1923

- instructions to painting on a grid were dictated to the enamel factory in Weimar, Germany over the phone
- EM 1, EM 2, and EM 3 were made at large, medium, and small scale, respectively
- a tele-communicated artwork

"After encountering the work of the Russian avant-garde at an exhibition in Berlin in the early 1920s, Moholy-Nagy was persuaded by these artists’ belief that a revolutionary society demanded a radically new artistic language. He incorporated these ideas into his teaching at the Bauhaus."

"By rejecting unique, handmade artwork in favor of serial mechanical production in his “telephone pictures,” Moholy-Nagy emphasized the role of the modern artist as a producer of concepts rather than a craftsman physically involved in the making of the work."

**Light space modulator**

![[cri_000000444916.jpg]]

![[vitra-design-museum-lightopia-Light-Space-Modulator-László-Moholy-Nagy.jpg]]

The Light-Space Modulator is the most spectacular and complete realization of László Moholy-Nagy’s artistic philosophy. Machine parts and mechanical structures began to appear in his paintings after his emigration from Hungary, and they are also seen in the illustrations he selected for the 1922 Buch neuer Künstler (Book of new artists), which includes pictures of motorcars and bridges as well as painting and sculpture. Many contemporary artists incorporated references to machines and technology in their work, and some, like the Russian Constructivist Vladimir Tatlin, even designed plans for fantastic structures, such as the ambitious Monument to the Third International, a proposed architectural spiral of glass and steel with moving tiers and audiovisual broadcasts.

In the Light-Space Modulator, Moholy-Nagy was able to create an actual working mechanism. Although he censured capitalism’s inhumane use of technology, he believed it could be harnessed to benefit mankind and that the artist had an important role in accomplishing this. Moholy had made preliminary sketches for kinetic sculptures as early as 1922 and referred to the idea for a light machine in his writings, but it was not until production was financed by an electric company in Berlin in 1930 that this device was built, with the assistance of an engineer and a metalsmith. It was featured at the Werkbund exhibition in Paris the same year, along with the short film Light Display Black-White-Gray, made by Moholy-Nagy to demonstrate and celebrate his new machine.

The Light-Space Modulator is a Moholy-Nagy painting come to life: mobile perforated disks, a rotating glass spiral, and a sliding ball create the effect of photograms in motion. With its gleaming glass and metal surfaces, this piece (now in the collection of the Busch-Reisinger Museum at Harvard University) is not only a machine for creating light displays but also a sculptural object of beauty, photographed admiringly by its creator.

Early 1930's - works on the lecture circuit across Europe.

1934 - exile in Amsterdam

1935 - move to London

![[cri_000000005675.jpg]]

mid 1930's - commercial design projects to sustain his small family

### The New Bauhaus

1937 - Offer mediated by Gropius to head up the New Bauhaus (Chicago Institute of Design at the Illinois Institute of Technology)

Late 1930's - stability and access to new materials and darkroom

![[MoholyNagy-Pins-Ribbons.jpg]]

At the New Bauhaus: a return to the photogram. Influence of light, motion, sculptural take, color.

1946 - Moholy-Nagy dies of Leukemia

1947 - Vision in Motion is published in the United States.

*Writing - painting - sculpture - teaching - collaborating: it is all the same for Moholy-Nagy.*

<hr>

### Vision in Motion

![[large 1.jpg]]

**Analyzing the Situation**

Published in 1947, Moholy-Nagy's *Vision in Motion* is a close look at his perspective on design and design education as he developed it in Chicago at the New Bauhaus.

His introductory essay in this book is as close as he may have gotten to an explicit "manifesto." Moholy-Nagy was true to his avant garde, leftist, roots for his entire life.

the introduction sums up Moholy-Nagy's project:

"Since the industrial revolution our civilization has suffered from a growing discrepancy between ideological potentiality and actual realization."

- Humankind has advnaced technologically, but perspective remains "provincial"
- Social effects of technology often go out of control
- the promise of technology to advance society has not yet been met.

"Man has invented pseudo-fundamentals to camoflage the ancient ailment of economic inequality and squalor."

- the industrial revolution ultimately served the bottom line
- economic superiority in favor of justice
- wars as cruel attempts to win capitalistic competition

"The social and economic chaos of the world and the intellectual, emotional, and spiritual misery of the individual are appalling."

- it is the duty of the current generation to change direction - not focus on the past.

"Tradition is man-made and must be constantly reevaluated, adhered to, or discarded, depending on fundamental, common needs, not upon delusions which only extenuate social guilt."

"Our generation must accept the challenge to reinvestigate the elements of healthy living so that these can be used as yardsticks to clarify conditions around us. By integrating this newly gained knowledge with the existing social dynamics, we could direct our steps towards a harmony of individual and social needs."

<hr>

***Inalienable Rights***

![[160606_schjeldahl_04.jpg]]

Moholy pulls out the idea of enlightenment, which ironically, was a precursor to the industrial revolution, and draws on the Declaration of independence:

"all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness."

It is a remarkble statement - evidence of the intention of the creative bourgeois of the industrial revolution. Ultimately they succeeded in breaking the hold of nobility and monarchy. - 

The result?

The merchant has become the ruler.

"The beorgoise fought against the discrimination of the class above it but inherited the ancient ideology of superiority of those on the next lower level with whom it was not considered fit to share the responsibilites of government."

<hr>

***Specialists***

![[moholy-nagy-q-1922-23-web.jpg]]

As industry expanded rapidly, specialization increased greatly.

Division of labor numbs one's understanding of the world around them.

With specialization the worker has become "inanimate"

Education has become 'vocational' - no longer creative. No longer 'univerasal' - it's greatest asset.

But, as production has increased, profit has increased, people have been too distracted to notice.

**People end up knowing "more and more about less and less"**

<hr>

***Diminished Moral Obligations***

![[1973_008_o2.jpg]]

Specialization, socially, trains people to "mind their own business"

Specialization leads to isolation.

No longer any broad vision of social planning.

As a result: No one cares. Irresponsibilty persists everywhere.

"Altogether, responsibility has been subdivided to the evasiveness of the microscope."

<hr>

***Indivisible Education***

![[28a1e0b90246ef39cd4dc7717916e270.png]]

Preliterary education was by myth and folklore

In most mythologies - good is rewarded and evil is punished

People aspired to follow in the footsteps of mytholigical heroes.

There was an oral history of guidance.

The Greeks evolved to appreciate - body and mind. Skill and shrewdness was no longer enough.

People developed emotionally by a close contact with the arts.

Independent thought and contemplation is indispensible to society.

<hr>

***Official and Unofficial Education***

![[Screen Shot 2016-07-18 at 9.41.13 AM.png]]

In the middle ages only select few benefited from a formal education - but here also, emphais was put on the integration of all abilites.

But even the toilers enjoyed a modest education - gaining enough insight to appreciate all aspects of society.

The preliterate culture was destroyed by the industrial revolution.

People did enjoy somelevel of 'immediate education' but Time and space for creative activity was lost.

People lost the idea that:  "Not knowledge but the power to acquire it is the goal of education."

Unofficial education lives on - so much more efficient with mass communication and technology.

1000 forces trying to influence pubic opinion: advertising, town hall meetings, art, science, a mightly propagnda machine exists of interwoven parts run by lobbyists and special interest groups, monopolists, and politicians.

<hr>

***Confusion Around Science***

![[96766f04cde694db503fafb6f63f9a98.jpg]]

As scientific inquiry became more independent of meta-physics, complications arose out of investigating what is "taboo"

Example: human evolution, Darwinism is still considered amoral by many. Same for Marxist and Freudian theory. People, out of tradition, resist theory which may ead to them abandoning their foundations.

The dilemma of the beorgeois: need science to make them money but science has the potential to destroy the status quo.

From Francis Bacon:

"There is another great and powerful cause why the sciences have made but little progress. It is not possible to run a course aright when the goal itself has not been rightly placed."

The way Capitalists deal with the problem of science: objectivity and neutrality.

And so: confusion prevails.

<hr>

***The Propaganda Machine***

![[A-19-Laszlo-Moholy-Nagy.jpg]]

Besides the ideological confustion around "objective" and "subjective" truth - the public is bombarded with information desireable for the protection of vested interests.

This service is not concerned with human or social essentials.

This fills the emotional life of an individual with worthless schemes.

While the public is eager to learn they have no ability to think analytically.

Minds become filled with "straw and predjudice."

Woth no tools of integration, the individual is unable to relate all this casual and scattered information into meaningful synthesis.

Everything is clichés

Loss of organic desire of self expression.

Longing for direct contact with creative forces existence becomes being well informed and well entertained.

Commentators as substitute for independent thinking.

<hr>

***Careerists***

![[05309801.jpg]]

People are taught that the best way to live is by using other people's energy, other people's results.

Industrial era brings on the extinction of the amateur and the arrival of the careerist.

The goal has become the commercialization of expression, not producing out of conviction but out of a desire to provide technical skill to whatever is asked.

Humanity has evolved because of the integration of a total integration of thought, creativity, resourcefulness. Ability to master ones surroundings, ones emotions. 

But these impulses have been sedated under the tinsel of an easy going life of applicances and amenities. Things too overestimated in their value.

It's a waste to:

- have eyes and not see
- ears and not hear
- to destroy the endowment of the instinct to create

Humankind as an individual, and as a whole, is affected - intergenerationally affected

Humankind no longer even knows what it needs.

Physiological and psychological impulses of acquiring and releasing a broad range of emotional and intellectual experiences has been neglected.

The industrial / information world is complex - we do need specialists.

"But the new specialist must integrate is special subject with the social whole. This integration must be based upon a crefully fostered intuitive and reasoning power, the result of emotional and intellectual development in balance."

<hr>

***Liberal Education***

![[05311001.jpg]]

Liberal education is supposed to counteract the downsides of specialization but it ends up augmenting it.

Vocation education without an eye on technological advances may end up reinforcing outmoded technologies. 

Liberal education without pause for social thought often conditions the student to petrified forms of class-determined. It solidifies old worldviews.

Liberal education may cut a path toward social or anti-social direction.

<hr>

Unofficial vs official education as a theme for Moholy-Nagy

<hr>

***Stabilizing the Transitory***

![[C3qpGeXUcAIqwxI.jpg]]

In unofficial education (propaganda / mass media) ephemeral aims transform into solid facts.

"To redirect the industrial world towards a balance between biologically sound human existence and the present industrial society, and to create a planned, cooperative economy, requires - almost - a revolution."

Because economic based leadership usually supresses constructive proposals for necessary changes.

<hr>

***Second Hand Facts***

![[05310301.jpg]]

Most knowledge today is in the form of distilled, passed down information

Most formal education is abbreviated

Yet - mechanicalistic adoption of lessons of the past ends up being hollow.

Memorized facts lead to showy demonstrations - of unrelated learning.

Students as encyclopedic symbols

Arts, crafts, experiential learning - has become derogatory - and is often thrown out of education.

Students are left with a thin atmosphere of mere verbalism.

<hr>

***Attempts at Improvements***

![[x18t8uifffty.jpg]]

Montessori education has it's merts. It brought children into complex awareness by re-enacting life in minature. But it didn't do enough to instill creativity. Imagination flattened by immediate practical applications.

Progressive education has it's merits too. But the goal is a verbalized performance, but it needs to be correlated with other means of expression: painting, sculpture, poetry, play, music.

Colleges and Universities can do much to bridge the gap between departments - between specialization. But the students are the ones bridging the gaps - not the professors.

The task at hand is to:

- give the student opportunity to use their brain
- to allow for emotional potential
- provide for multi-sensory experience
- not lead or cast an individual
- avoid second hand experience

Education as an opportunity to make ones own discoveries. Form an individual expression.

Education as purposeful accumulation of guided expereiences.

Humankind must utilize the full range of of the body of culture and civilization.

The goal should not always be clear because it can't always be clear. One must be allowed the space to continually reassess.

Knowledge needs to be in relation to sociobiological aims.

Social goals - goals that serve the group - also serve the individual.

Focus on devotion to task / unselfishness.

Cooperation as the standard.

"Economical" should be subordinated to human requirements to make technology a benefit rather than a curse.

"Think in efficiency, not in dollars and sense"
-Walter Gropius

Aim for producing for human needs - not for profit.

<hr>

***The task of this generation***

![[126249_c9609b6d-06ae-4e82-a5d1-90eaa5243fab_-1_570.jpg]]

Each generation differs from the preceding one in terms of their task.

The task of this generation is to search for it's roots.

Reaffrim an awareness of living: "the preservation and refinement of th biological nature of the individual within a harmonious social existence."

The arts can play a big role in helping people live a more fulfilled existence.

Everything is currently in flux. the best we can do is grasp for a new imagery and a new rhythmic structure. This new imagery being the essence of the manifold potentialites of this yet-chaotic world translated into a language of directness and intensity.

<hr>

***Capacities***

![[lucia-moholy.jpg]]

Every person has the capacity to develop such a language of integration.

Everyone has a creative nature

Everyone is naturally equipped to recieve and assimilate sensory experiences.

Everyone is capable of thinking and feeling.

A general standard of self expression without specialization is possible.

It can't be overstated:

- everyone is sensitive to musical tones
- colors
- touch
- space relationships

Everyone is capable in engaging in other-than-verbal expression.

The truth of this is apparent in everyday life. Also, there is proof in the lives of children and primitive peoples: spontaneous expression spring from an inner sense of adequacy not shaken by the need for "perfection"

Without emotional articulation and expression life becomes one great frustration.

<hr>

***Fear***

![[cri_000000214010.jpg]]

Fear and self consciousness are the great hindrances in life.

People tend to reach toward becoming perfectionists.  But this leads to fear - paralysis at the thought of being laughed at.

Students walk in the shadow of greatness not realizing the struggle to get there.

Instinct of self preservation will often react against this vicous dogma of inferiority - if you let it.

Every school should build up a curriculum with exercises that do not compare outcomes to genius

Student must gain a range of experience through experiments. Before studying what is historically great. This aids in confidence.

This would also reduce the tendency in education to produce automatons.

"A little boy, when asked how he drew a beautiful picture said he only thought - and then drew around the think"

Goals: observation - fantasy - creativity

<hr>

***The Amateur***

![[46ed3e4b1965e5e023585bfc2a6d7b6f.jpg]]

Someday art may be understood in more scientific terms.

We currently now why it works but not necessarily how it works.

Psychoanalysis, the analysis of dreams, subconscious existence - are all related to the importance od creativity and justify that one day the mechanics of creative work may be understood.

With this knowledge creativity can become part of the everyday.

Art cannot be taught - only the mechanics of technique - which leads to "art" - an organization of the elements of expression directed toward communication and social coherence.

Analyzing a reinterpreting classical art used to be enough. The idea that if you learn the rules and repeat the recipes you can be an artist. But the better advice is: be yourself - alert, honest, and human.

The amateur is one of the hopeful promises of a future society.

The amateur is example of the manifiold capabilities of the individual to act and react purposefully.

Art may be the result of an inner drive.

Art can be therapy - purgative of emotional overflow.

Art is as natural as breathing

"Only the person who is able to rise beyond private sensations and translate an intuitive grasp of the unadulterated problems of their time into imagery, into coherent expression, into visible, audible, tactile forms - can be a capable of the best"

The above is only achieved when working in a broad sense - full time experimentation - saturated in the knowledge and spirit of the past and present civilization.

People must work to avoid aesthetic starvation.

<hr>

***The Function of Art***

![[05182701.jpg]]

Art is the most complex, vitalizing, civilizing of human actions. It is biologically necessary.

Art produces an inner and outer balance of social - intellectual - emotional existence.

Art has two faces: biological and social - toward individual and toward group.

Art leads to coherence.

Unused creative energy leads to neurosis/

Art is remedy by sublimation of aggressive impulses

Art educated and revitalizes

Art is rehabilitative and restorative.

<hr>

***The Professional Artist***

![[3047.jpg]]

The best of the arts is the spiritual expression of the times.

If an artist wishes to reach the audience, they must create powerful new relationships that fit the age.

"It is unimaginable that along with economists, philosophers, politicians who advance suggestions for social changes, the most intuitive and responsible people in a society, namely, the artists, have no say."

Tyranny and manifestos will not recast the mentality of the people.

Unconscious but direct influence of art represents a better means of persuasionfor conditioning people to a new society  by either projective or stiric/destructive means.

The true artist sharpens eyes, minds and feelings. Interprets ideas and concepts through his own media.

Artists must take a stand.

The most sensitive and advanced artist is a tool for the recording of the time-expressive contents. Form and structure denote spiritual trends.

Art presses for solutions to social problems just as energetically as social revolutionaries do through political action.

Art is political.

The conscious and subconscious mind absorbs and synthesizes social ideas that are expressed in the media of the arts.

The difficulty lies in mass participation. When sensitivities are killed (by the unofficial education) - they are unable to recieve or transmit the messages of art.

"the artist represents the consciousness and memory of their time"

A professional artist can not be bribed.

No one but the painter, author, performer is a master of the performance.

The artist is the seismograph of culture.

To be a professional involves a responsibility.

The secured existence of the incorruptible artist is necessary to society.

Artists should not have to fight for minimum subsistence.

"The silly myth that artist must suffer is the sly excuse of a society which does not care for its productive members unless their work promises immediate technological or economic applications with calcuable profit"

<hr>

***Art and Science***

![[2015_NYR_03736_0040C_000(laszlo_moholy-nagy_srho_1044215).jpg]]

The task of the professional artist is to continue and synthesize spiritual traits.

To do this, the artist must have conscious source material - a scientific outlook though not necessarily a scientific method.

Sober science vs mystical religion is an oversimplification.

Artists need to be experimenters.

Without experimentation there are no discoveries, without discoveries, no regeneration.

Art and science / two sides of the same coin?
- Art is defined by the creative act even if the execution is formulaic
- Science is defined by rational discourse even if the question comes from subconscious impulse.

Artists have the responsibility to not only their niche but to the integrated whole - to apply their experiments toward the totality of experience.

<hr>

***Vision in Motion***

![[DA000418.jpg]]

vision in motion

is a simultaneous grasp. Simultaneous grasp is a creative performance - seeing, feeling, and thinking in relationship and not as a series of isolated phenomena. It instantaneously integrates and transmutes single elements into a coherent whole. This is valid for physical vision as well as for the abstract.

![[Moholy-Nagy-ChBeataI-48.1128_ph.jpg]]

vision in motion

is a synonym for simultaneity and space-time; a means to comprehend the new dimension.

![[6d07e99ee5756d9287643bb3f4a4dd3b.jpg]]

vision in motion

is seeing while moving.

vision in motion

![[unnamed 19.jpg]]

is seeing moving objects either in reality or in forms of visual representation as in cubism and futurism. In the latter case the spectator, stimulated by the specific means of rendering, recreates mentally and emotionally the original motion.

vision in motion

also signifies planning, the projective dynamics of out visionary faculties.

![[space-modulator-digital-remastered-edition-laszlo-moholy-nagy.jpg]]
