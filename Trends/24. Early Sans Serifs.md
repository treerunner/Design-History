- called 'grotesque' because they were seen as quite ugly and obnoxious compared to their more ornate predecessors — the Modern Serifs and Roman type styles.

- another pre-Akzidenz font
- developed in 1908 at the Leipzig punchcutting firm Wagner & Schmidt
- squarish shape as compared to other grotesks
- has confused designers and historians alike over the years, as the same design had been available under different names from many type foundries throughout Germany – among them Berthold, Stempel, and Weber – and beyond, including Poppelbaum in Vienna, Austria; Nebiolo in Turin, Italy; and Berling in Lund, Sweden.

- Berthold Type Foundry of Berlin. 
- "Akzidenz" indicates its intended use as a typeface for commercial print runs such as publicity, tickets and forms, as opposed to fine printing, and "grotesque" was a standard name for sans-serif typefaces at the time.
- belongs to a tradition of general-purpose, unadorned sans-serif types that had become dominant in German printing during the 19th century
- Relatively little-known for a half-century after its introduction
- achieved iconic status in the post-war period as the preferred typeface of many Swiss graphic designers in what became called the 'International' or 'Swiss' design style which became popular across the Western world in the 1950s and 1960s.
- simple, neutral design has also influenced many later typefaces.
- a variety of digital versions have been released by Berthold and other companies.

- 'monoline' in structure, with all strokes of the letter of similar width
- sense of simplicity and an absence of the adornment and flourishes seen in the more decorative sans-serifs of the late 19th century influenced by the Art Nouveau style.
-  Modern type designer Martin Majoor has described the general design of Akzidenz-Grotesk and its ancestors as similar in letterforms to the Didone serif fonts that were standard printing types in the 19th century, such as Didot, Walbaum and their followers. This is most visible in the quite folded-up apertures of letters such as ‘a’ and ‘c’.
-  didone minus serifs and contrast.

- break with grotesques, which tended to have squarer shapes inspired by signwriting and Didone type of the period. 

Some aspects of the alphabet are geometric: 
- the letter O is a nearly perfect circle
- 'M', unlike Roman capitals (but like Caslon) straight-sided. 
- As with most serif fonts, the 'g' is a 'two-storey' design. 
- The 'l' copies the curl of the 't' and produces a rather wide letter compared to most sans-serif fonts.

- A Teacher: inspired many students at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London’s Southampton Row, 
- one student: typeface designer and sculptor Eric Gill, well known for is typeface Gill Sans. 
- Eric Gill worked on the development of the Johnston typeface, later used it as a model for his own Gill Sans, released from 1928. 
- As a corporate font, Johnston was not available for public licensing until recently, and as such Gill Sans has become more widely used.
