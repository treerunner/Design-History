By 200,000 years ago, the pace of innovation in stone technology began to accelerate. Middle Stone Age toolkits included: 

- points, which could be hafted on to shafts to make spears
- stone awls, which could have been used to perforate hides
- scrapers that were useful in preparing hide, wood, and other materials.

In 2002 the recovery of two finely engraved ochre pieces was reported in Science Magazine. The surfaces of both pieces were intentionally modified by scraping and grinding, and the engraved pattern formed a distinct cross-hatched design in combination with parallel incised lines. In 2009, six additional pieces of engraved ochre – this time recovered from entire Middle Stone Age sequence dated to between 70,000 and 100,000 years old – were announced

### Pictographs

dots - squares - circles - squiggles

people - animals - birds - fish - stars - water - mountains

Early written symbols were based on pictographs.

- pictographs: pictures which resemble what they signify

- ideograms: symbols which represent ideas

Ancient Sumerian, Egyptian, and Chinese civilizations began to adapt such symbols to represent concepts, developing them into logographic writing systems. 

Pictographs are still in use in literate and non-literate cultures today.

Pictographs are often used as simple, pictorial, representational symbols by most contemporary cultures.

- art

- a basis in the ability to write: symbols for spoken words.

"It's not what it looks like but what it does that defines a symbol"
