### Suprematism - Kasimir Malevich

- Russian avant-garde artist and art theorist
- pioneering work and writing had a profound influence on the development of non-objective, or abstract art, in the 20th century
- Born in Kyiv to an ethnic Polish family
- "Suprematism" sought to develop a form of expression that moved as far as possible from the world of natural forms (objectivity) and subject matter in order to access "the supremacy of pure feeling" and spirituality.
- 1915 Suprematism manifesto, "From Cubism to Suprematism"
- 1915–1916, he worked with other Suprematist artists in a peasant/artisan co-operative in Skoptsi and Verbovka village
- 1916–1917, participated in exhibitions of the Jack of Diamonds group in Moscow together with Nathan Altman, David Burliuk, Aleksandra Ekster and others.

Black Square, 1915

Malevich exhibited his first Black Square, now at the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow, at the Last Futurist Exhibition 0,10 in Petrograd (Saint Petersburg) in 1915

“The square is not a subconscious form. It is the creation of intuitive reason. The face of the new art. The square is a living, regal infant. The first step of pure creation in art.”

- radically non-representational
- Kantian sublime: ‘the feeling of displeasure that arises from the imagination’s inadequacy’ in an estimation of ‘formlessness’ or ‘magnitude’
- viewer experiences pain brought about by the breakdown of representation followed by a powerful sense of relief, even elation, at the thought that the formless or massive can nevertheless be grasped as a mode of reason.
- artistic endeavour at its most elementary (Zizek)
