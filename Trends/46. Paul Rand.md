## Paul Rand

![[Paul-Rand-Design.jpg]]

"The term graphic design was virtually unheard of in the 1920s. Even though WA Dwiggens referred to it, it was not a generally accepted term. How could one know about Jan Tschichold .. in Brooklyn, or Brownsville, or East New York? ONe knew about "pool sharks" and ice pick murderers but not about Jan Tschichold or the New Typography."
– Paul Rand

"Ideals ought to aim at the transformation of reality"
– William James

"Among all these young Americans, it seems that Paul Rand is one of the best and most competent. He is an idealist and a realist, who uses the language of the poet and the businessman."
– Moholy-Nagy on Paul Rand

**Thoughts on Design**

“Paul’s a gem who works on perfecting the exterior of a curmudgeon,”
-Steve Jobs

At the age of only thirty-three, Rand collected these uncompromising principles and his rare brand of idealism in the influential 1947 volume Thoughts on Design.

In the foreward, Michael Beirut calls Thoughts on Design:
“a manifesto, a call to arms and a ringing definition of what makes good design good.”

“almost as simple as a child’s storybook: short, clear sentences; vivid, playful illustrations”

Some quotes.

*Form and Function*

"Visual communications of any kind … should be seen as the embodiment of form and function: the integration of the beautiful and the useful. ... Ideally, beauty and utility are mutually generative."

![[Paul Rand- Defining Design 02 Installed Hallway 23.jpg]]

"The system that regards esthetics as irrelevant, which separates the artist from his product, which fragments the work of the individual, which creates by committee, and which makes mincemeat of the creative process will, in the long run, diminish not only the product but the maker as well."

*Being Cross-Disciplinary*

![[Container Corporation of America 02b.jpg]]

"To achieve an effective solution to his problem, the designer must necessarily go through some sort of mental process. Conscious or not, he analyzes, interprets, formulates. He is aware of the scientific and technological developments in his own and kindred fields. He improvises, invents, or discovers new techniques and combinations. He co-ordinates and integrates his material so that he may restate his problem in terms of ideas, signs, symbols, pictures. He unifies, simplifies, and eliminates superfluities. He symbolizes — abstracts from his material by association and analogy. He intensifies and reinforces his symbol with appropriate accessories to achieve clarity and interest. He draws upon instinct and intuition. He considers the spectator, his feelings and predilections."

![[eye_bee_m.jpg]]

*Symbols*

![[1_duMOjy5_n-x9_3pLK2aGdQ@2x.jpg]]

"It is in a world of symbols that man lives. The symbol is thus the common language between artist and spectator."

![[download 7.jpg]]

"The fact that some of the best symbols are simplified images merely points to the effectiveness of simplicity but not to the meaning of the word per se. In essence, it is not what it looks like but what it does that defines a symbol."

*Humor*

![[Digitization23028.jpg]]

Stressing the profound effects of entertainment, Plato, in the Republic, declares, 'therefore do not use compulsion, but let early education be rather a sort of amusement...'"

*Rhythm*

![[RAND_ca1946_Abacus.jpg]]

The emotional force generated by the repetition of words or pictures and the visual possibilities (as a means of creating texture, movement, rhythm, indicating equivalences for time and space) should not be minimized…

![[miscellany11.jpg]]

The following are but a few instances of our everyday experiences in which the magical, almost hypnotic, effects of repetition operate: the exciting spectacle of marching soldiers, in the same dress, same step, and same attitude; the fascination of neatly arranged flower beds of like color, structure, and texture; the impressive sight of crowds at football games, theaters, public demonstrations; the satisfaction we derive from the geometric patterns created by ballet dancers and chorus girls with identical costumes and movements; the feeling of order evoked by rows of methodically placed packages on the grocer’s shelf; the comforting effect of the regularity of repeat patterns in textiles and wallpapers; the excitement we experience at the sight of plane formations or birds in flight.

*Reader Participation*

![[Container Corporation of America 01.jpg]]

"It is a truism that the fundamental problem of the advertiser and publisher is to get the message into the reader's mind."

![[1_Rvf_FGbZKCHDhnXT50yMaA.jpg]]

"Among the great contributions to visual thought is the invention of the collage"

![[6a27182b9e588869d00aba49dbdf3383-753x1024.jpg]]

"Compactness of the complex message in a single picture more readily enables the spectator to focus attention on the advertiser's message."

*Photograms*

![[94778_a92a4e31a714fe4b_b.jpg]]

Although some of its effects may be approximated with pen, brus, or scissors, the quality inhernent in subtle light modulations can be achieved only by means of the photogram

![[10-Examples-of-Minimalist-Design-to-Inspire-Your-Own-Creations-Historic-examples-of-minimalist-design-Paul-Rand-1.jpg]]

*Numbers*

"Numbers impart to a printed piece a sense of rhythm and immediacy."

![[SKF-propspectus, color.jpg]]

*Repetition*

The emotional force generated by the repetition of words or pictures, and the visual possibilities, (as a means of creating texture, movement, and rhythm, indicating equivalances for time and space) should not be minimized"

![[1_YFMliCj9191BMSBDcQjpnQ.jpg]]

*Symmetry*

"Bilateral symmetry offers the spectator too simple and too obvious a statement. it offers him little or no intellectual pleasure, no challenge. For the pleasure derived from observing asymmetric arrangements lies partly in overcoming resistances which, consciously or not, the spectator has in his own mind, thus acquiring some sort of esthetic satisfaction."

*The Isolated Letter*

The isolated letter affords a means of visual expression which other kinds of imagery cannot quite duplicate. Letters in the form of trademarks, seals, and monograms - on business forms, identification tags, athletic jerseys, or even handkerchiefs, - posess some magical quality. They serve not only as status symbols but have the virtue of brevity as well."

![[direction_1941_04_3_00.jpg]]

*Responsibility*

"Even if it is true that the average man seems most comfortable with the commonplace and familiar, it is equally true that catering to bad taste, which we so readily attribute to the average reader, merely perpetuates that mediocrity and denies the reader one of the most easily accessible means for esthetic development and eventual enjoyment."
