### eye-catching

**adjective**

1. tending to attract attention; striking

Good design is noticed. At a certain point in the trajectory of your career as a graphic designer, you will begin to notice the work of other designers. A lot of this is contemporary work, stuff you see your peers creating, or other designers who are working on simliar things as you. You might notice *trends*. Or, you might notice something that is a cut above the rest. Something that, maybe, sets trends.

The history of design is a very long list. Of eye-catching work. And trend setting designers. It's also an account of what we know about what has been committed to design up to now. But it's also an account of relationships, linkages, *power*. There are multiple histories, multiple threads, multiple perspectives. Just like regular history. A great deal of history patiently awaits it's turn.

You may have an a-ha moment when creating new work. Something you have discovered for yourself, alone. But more often than not, your work was informed by something that caught your eye. We are all part of that flow - of material, of time, of culture.

**Design History is an Entry to Design Theory**

“Eyes and brains have worked the same way over generations … the environment changes but the principles of visual communication survive. History helps us understand these principles.” 
– Richard Hollis, *Principles Before Style: Questions in Design History*

Many questions have been addressed through history. Much research has been done that can be used as a starting point into your own work.

“Graphic designers should be literate in graphic design history.  
Being able to design well is not always enough. Knowing the roots  
of design is necessary to avoid reinvention, no less inadvertent plagiarism.”
– Steven Heller, *Introduction to Graphic Design History*

**Design History Helps One Cultivate a Critical Eye**

Design Literacy.

Will the things one creates stand up the test of time? Hopefully, yes. Having an understanding of history helps us know the difference between what will work and hold it's own going forward and what may not. History allows one access to a trove of work, the more you look at it, the more informed your own choices as a designer will become.

And the more resistant you will become to fads, and worse - extremism. Which is important in today's media obsessed, media oversaturated envirinment.

**Design History Tells Us About Culture**

The visual record left behind by graphic designers tells us a lot about the society that the designer lived in. Good design transmits good ideas. Not so good design comes from not so good ideas.

“For after all, a poster does more than simply supply information on the goods it advertises; it also reveals a society’s state of mind”  
– Armin Hofmann

**The History of Design Helps You Be a Better Designer**

“… if we understand the past, we will be better able to continue  a culture legacy of beautiful form and effective communication. If we ignore this legacy, we run the risk of becoming buried in a mindless morass of a commercialism whose mole-like vision  
ignores human values and needs as it burrows forward into darkness..” 
– Philip B. Meggs
