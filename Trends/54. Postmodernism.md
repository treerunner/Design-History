Toward the end of the 1960's many believed the modern era was finally drawing to a close.

- Cultural norms were being scrutinized.
- Pluralism emerging
- Underlying tenets of modernism questioned
- Accepted viewpoints challenged
- Modernism no longer needed in post industrial era
- Cultural change

*But what exactly is postmodernism? *

No one really knows, exactly. It's murky. It's a label from a time when labels become tenuous.

In design, postmodern is any work that directly engages in a questioning of the modern design aesthetic or worldview. Postmodernism was a challenge. It can be seen as a backlash to the International Style that was so prevalent up to the late 1960's.

In order to set themselves against modernism, "postmodern" designers took up:

- decoration
- historical references
- the vernacular
- self expression (the "me" generation of the 1970's)

Postmodern graphic design can be loosely categorized in the following directions:

1. Extensions of International Typographic Style / New Wave Typography
2. Exuberant Mannerism / Memphis Group
3. Retro
4. Deconstruction
5. Digital Revolution

### New Wave Typography

New Wave design was influenced by Punk and postmodern language theory. But there is a debate as to whether New Wave is a break or a natural progression of the Swiss Style. 

- a rection to the coporatization of International Typographic Style
- embraced expression
- sans-serif predominates but legibility is no longer a goal
- break from grid
- text hierarchy not necessarily top down
- return to collage
- less isn't necessarily more

**Wolfgang Weingart**

“What's the use of being legible, when nothing inspires you to take notice of it?”
–Wolfgang Weingart

Wolfgang Weingart is credited with developing New Wave typography in the early 1970s at the Basel School of Design, Switzerland.

“Accelerated by the social unrest of our generation, the force behind Swiss Typography and its philosophy of reduction was losing its international hold. My students were inspired, we were on to something different, and we knew it.”

Weingart’s typographic experimentation spanned across three different eras of typesetting technology: letterpress, phototypesetting and the computer. Yet, despite how readily he accepted and pushed the boundaries of the letterpress and phototypesetting processes, he is rather unenthusiastic about the computer technology. The computer, to him, is too illusive. He compares the computer to a digital watch: a traditional watch shows a ‘landscape’, it tells a story; a digital watch only shows a particular moment. That’s why Weingart’s students do not design on the computer – they are asked to first work out their ideas by hand. Weingart wants his students to experience design as a tactile, hands-on experience. It is surprising that he was probably also the first person to introduce the Macintosh computer into the type shop in Switzerland.

DOUGLAS W SCHMIDT, 1980

April Greiman (born March 22, 1948) is an American designer widely recognized as one of the first designers to embrace computer technology as a design tool. Greiman is also credited, along with early collaborator Jayme Odgers, with helping to import the European New Wave design style to the US during the late 70s and early 80s."

Greiman moved to Los Angeles in 1976 where she established the multi-disciplinary approach where she "...blends technology, science, word and image with color and space..."

n 1982, Greiman became head of the design department at the California Institute of the Arts, also known as Cal Arts. Upon her relocation from New York City to Los Angeles, she met photographer-artist Jayme Odgers, who became a significant influence on Greiman. Together, they designed a famous Cal Arts poster in 1977 that became an icon of the California New Wave.

“At the heart of the concept of hybrid imagery is a recognition that, in inventing new technologies, we reinvent ourselves,” Greiman explained. “In the end, we can never be sure of who is creating who.”

*Does it Make Sense?*

![[DQ-133_April_Greiman-1.png]]

Los Angeles-based designer April Greiman was commissioned to create issue 133 of the long-running journal Design Quarterly published by the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. Greiman, already known for her experimental use of media such as photographic collage and still video imagery, had been early adopter of the Macintosh computer, first released in 1984. For this tour-de-force edition, the usual 32 pages of the magazine were treated as a two-foot-by-six-foot, double-sided fold-out. It was printed in color on a large format offset press and was folded down to the same trim size as the publication and housed in a paper slipcase. Using MacDraw software, Greiman was able to incorporate images captured from a video camera and generate typography, all composed within the same program. The software also allowed for tiling multiple pages to create large printouts, necessary to capture and print a pixelated, life-size, double self-portrait. 

"So I'm walking through the English Garden with Andreas - and I mention the idea (duality) of order and chaos. So, he tips me off to the latest philosophical twist - chaos is simply a man/mind-made invention that frankly doesn't exist! I think about this and say..yea, come to think about it, in seeing a computer model of a fractal geometry, things that appear without structures, such as clouds and montains, are in fact orderly processes. While on the surface, things seem irregular and chaotic, when you break down the parts, in reality they are more modular and ordered. The more finitely we perceive them, the more their inherent order becomes apparent."

### Memphis Group

![[3689bc33-599c-401c-b19a-652053f2c83e.jpg]]

The Memphis Group, also known as Memphis Milano, was an Italian design and architecture group founded by Ettore Sottsass. It was active from 1981 to 1988. The group designed Postmodern furniture, lighting, fabrics, carpets, ceramics, glass and metal objects.

![[02669f3075acf4152a7ff6a9f80d3691.png]]

The Memphis group's work often incorporated plastic laminate and terrazzo materials and was characterized by ephemeral design featuring colorful and abstract decoration as well as asymmetrical shapes, sometimes arbitrarily alluding to exotic or earlier styles and designs.

Also known as "exuberant mannerism"

The group's colorful furniture has been described as "bizarre", "misunderstood", "loathed", and "a shotgun wedding between Bauhaus and Fisher-Price".

While created in the 1980s, the colorful geometric style became most popular and widely accepted in the 1990s, where it influenced the design of furniture, architecture, household items, and clothes.

![[memphis-design-thumbnail.jpg]]

Like many creative movements, Memphis was a reaction against the status quo. The 1950s/60s mid-century modern and 1970s minimalism were about structure and straight lines. To counter that, Sottsass centered the group's thinking around “radical, funny, and outrageous”—essentially, disregarding what was considered in “good taste” at that time. The geometric figures of Art Deco, the color palette of Pop Art, and 1950s kitsch inspired their unusual aesthetic.

Features:

- Laminate and Terrazzo materials, which were usually found on floors, were incorporated into tables and lamps.
- Squiggles, aka the Bacterio print, was designed by Sottsass in 1978.
- Bright, multi-colored objects with a rejection of typical shapes. Often, instead of chair legs being rectangular, they’d be circles or triangles.

Ettore Sottsass' Carlton

![[ezgif-7-da2732c2a95b.jpg]]

The original Memphis Group created a wide range of bizarre creations that won celebrity fans from Karl Lagerfeld to David Bowie. The Ashoka lamp is one of them – but arguably the most iconic of all, and therefore the perfect start to this list, is Ettore Sottsass' Carlton.

Built from sections of laminated MDF, the Carlton could be seen as a bookcase, a room divider or a dresser – or all three – but like many of the Memphis Group's creations, it seems equally comfortable as a modern art installation.

### Retro and Vernacular Style

Retro and Vernacular design shows a return to historical styles as graphic designers began to grow in understanding and appreciation of that history during the 1980s. “The prefix retro suggests the term retrograde, implying “backward-looking” and “contrary to the usual. The term vernacular design refers to artistic and technical expression broadly characteristic of a locale or historical period; it closely relates to retro design.

The technique, of faking authenticity, helps to connect with viewers on an emotional level by evoking ideas of history, culture, a sense of localism, tradition, and nostalgia.

“Unorthodox attitudes about the accepted rules and regulations of design and typography permit them to take risks and experiment by exuberantly mixing fonts, using extreme letterspacing, and printing type in subtle color-on-color combinations”. Typography is the center point and plays an important role in the design and not secondary to photography and illustration.

**Charles Spencer Anderson**

Charles Spencer Anderson was born in Minneapolis Minnesota 1958.He graduated from Minneapolis College of Art and Design in 1981 and by 1985 had joined the edgy Duffy Design group where he became a parter. He was influenced by a curious mixture of mid-century New Bauhaus Modernism, which he was exposed to by his teacher and first employer, Peter Seitz. He also enjoyed canivalesque pop culture which he learned by studying design history.

In 1989, with only a single client, the French Paper Company, Anderson formed ,Charles S. Anderson Design. Anderson’s promotional campaign for the company, with its hybrid vintage type and iconography—he called it “the bonehead style”—comically critiques the ubiquity of these passé materials, thinking of them as valuable artifacts, not just kitsch novelties.Anderson had revived cartoony printer’s cuts and turned it into a graphic achievement. In popularizing these forms, Anderson also contributed to design culture by building on 'American commercial folk art'.

**Paul Scher**

Scher began her career creating album covers for both Atlantic and CBS records. However, it was not long before she formed her own design company, and after only a few years there she joined Pentagram. During her career she has created memorable identities and other work for clients such as Citi Bank, Coca-Cola, the Metropolitan Opera, the Museum of Modern Art and the New York Philharmonic, among others.

She has twice been married to designer Seymour Chwast and has been a public figure in design since her early career. Her style of design communicates with contemporary audiences through the use of pop iconography, music and film. Her work has been published internationally and her contributions to the field design are numerous. Her work as a partner of Pentagram continues to inspire the new generation of designers.

### Deconstruction

Jacques Derrida introduced the concept of ‘deconstruction’ in his book Of Grammatology, published in France in 1967 and translated into English in 1976. ‘Deconstruction’ became a banner for the advance guard in American literary studies in the 1970s and 80s, scandalizing departments of English, French, and comparative literature. 

Deconstruction rejected the project of modern criticism: to uncover the meaning of a literary work by studying the way its form and content communicate essential humanistic messages. 

Deconstruction, like critical strategies based on Marxism, feminism, semiotics, and anthropology, focuses not on the themes and imagery of its objects but rather on the linguistic and institutional systems that frame the production of texts.

### "Deconstruction refers to all of the techniques and strategies used by Derrida in order to destabilize, crack open and displace texts that are explicitly or invisibly idealistic" 
––Hottois, 1998.

In Derrida’s theory, deconstruction asks how representation inhabits reality. How does the external image of things get inside their internal essence? How does the surface get under the skin? Western culture since Plato, Derrida argues, has been governed by such oppositions as reality/representation, inside/outside, original/copy, and mind/body. The intellectual achievements of the West – its science, art, philosophy, literature – have valued one side of these pairs over the other, allying one side with truth and the other with falsehood. For example, the Judeo-Christian tradition has conceived the body as an external shell for the inner soul, elevating the mind as the sacred source of thought and spirit, while denigrating the body as mere mechanics. In the realm of aesthetics, the original work of art traditionally has carried an aura of authenticity that its copy lacks, and the telling of a story or the taking of a photograph is viewed as a passive record of events.

**Katherine McCoy**

During her extensive career spanning education and professional practice, McCoy worked with groundbreaking design firm Unimark, Chrysler Corporation, and with Muriel Cooper in the early days of MIT Press while at the Boston design firm Omnigraphics. McCoy's career in education was similarly broad, teaching at Cranbrook Academy of Art, Illinois Institute of Technology's Institute of Design, and the Royal College of Art, London. She is also the co-founder of High Ground, a workshop firm created for professional designers in their studios.

The Graduate Program in Design, 1989

Perforated with postcards on the reverse, this recruitment poster was designed by Cranbrook Academy of Art’s co-head of the design department, Katherine McCoy. McCoy pairs oppositional words across a center line, which serves as an anchor for a zig-zag effect created as more words and images fan out to the edges of the page. The composition of image and text is a play on deconstructivist ideas—you can read the text as an image and the images as text. The photomontage reinforces the bifurcation of the page, with the left side featuring designs from the 2D design department in pink, and the right featuring designs from the 3D design department in blue. This poster is a marked departure from McCoy’s earlier work at Cranbrook, and remains an icon of postmodern graphic design.

**David Carson / Raygun Magazine**

![[unnamed 31.jpg]]

While the contents of its pages were not related to graphic design, Ray Gun magazine proved to be an exploration of typography, layout and visual storytelling that would shift the approach of many graphic designers. The magazine was founded in 1992 and led by the work of David Carson, who served as its art director for the first three years of its career, which lasted 7 years and over 70 issues.

Carson's style of typographic experimentation influenced the development of the deconstruction style of design and a whole new generation of designers. The experiments by Carson and other Ray Gun designers were chaotic, abstract and distinctive, but sometimes illegible. The magazine's radical subject matter often related to music and pop culture icons and the magazine became a reliable source for the prediction of up-and-coming stars.

### “For the normative self-understanding of modernity, Christianity has functioned as more than just a precursor or catalyst. Universalistic egalitarianism, from which sprang the ideals of freedom and a collective life in solidarity, the autonomous conduct of life and emancipation, the individual morality of conscience, human rights and democracy, is the direct legacy of the Judaic ethic of justice and the Christian ethic of love. This legacy, substantially unchanged, has been the object of a continual critical reappropriation and reinterpretation. Up to this very day there is no alternative to it. And in light of the current challenges of a post-national constellation, we must draw sustenance now, as in the past, from this substance. Everything else is idle postmodern talk.”

― Jürgen Habermas
