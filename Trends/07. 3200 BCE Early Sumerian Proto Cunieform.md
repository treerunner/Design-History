The earliest form of writing on our planet, called proto-cuneiform, was invented in Mesopotamia during the Late Uruk period, about 3200 BC. Proto-cuneiform consisted of pictographs — simple drawings of the subjects of the documents — and early symbols representing those ideas, drawn or pressed into puffy clay tablets, which were then fired in a hearth or baked in the sun.
