## Pre-Cubist Pictorial Modernism

- Much of advertising desifgn in the first decade of the 20th C waas a continuation of Victorian and Post-Victorian style, technology, and form
- Some artists did begin to expore themes advanced by modernity
- But in the realm of the popular, there is ever a need to ground the design in a picture.

Expressive + symbolic VS. visual organization and picture plane = interesting visual dynamics.

"One of us gets an idea, said Pryde. We talk it over, the other suggests an addition, the matter is reconsidered, perhaps shelved away for months. Finally we draw the design very roughly with charcoal on big sheets of paper, and then place the lines and masses in their places on the groundwork, which is generally of ordinary brown paper."
– 1896 interview

“We want to produce our work well and with purpose so that it not only unburdens our conscience but also fulfils its intended function as a part of life. … The success of our effort will result from a slow and laborious evolution. That is our hope. Today, the businessman approaches says, present us with his wishes, and we are forced to submit to them. He frequently ignores your considerations and scruples, which results in work that does not satisfy us but to which we must sign our names. Nonetheless, I think there is no harm if our aesthetic sensibilities are occasionally slighted, since these matters are, after all, not so important that we should refuse to make any concessions. As long as we attempt to steadily develop and improve our work, we are doing our duty. If some misstep provides a potential target to unworldly aesthetes, it does us no damage. Slowly, the business world will understand that we are right about these things, just as we have recognized that the business world was right to curtail are excessively aesthetic ambitions…We are now experiencing a reaction to the excessive overrating of the decorative arts that occur 10 years ago.”

– From “A Reply,” in _Julius Klinger: Monographien Deutscher Reklamek__unstler_, 1912.

<hr>

Additionally, Cassandre designed a few typefaces:

**Bifur**

- 1929
- Cassandre's most experimental typeface
- Originally designed for advertising use, "this typography is based on a search for the very essence of the letter. It should make it possible to organise large architectural masses"
- composed exclusively of capital letters, 
- two distinct compositions in two tone variations
- Very well known today, it was however very badly welcomed at the time
- In 1929, avant-gardism advocated lower-case letters, capital letters referring to domination
- Cassandre sold Bifur as a writing attached to the past and concerned about grandeur, having for vocation to leave its imprint in the mind of the spectator.
- Despite a real desire for innovation and real advocacy, Bifur was not as successful as expected.

![[cassandre-catalogue-bifur.jpg]]

![[tumblr_n63lkiZkOD1rpgpe2o7_r1_1280.jpg]]

![[Source0.jpg]]

<hr>

**Acier** 

- 1936
- Designed for Deberny et Peignot, a large Parisian Foundry

![[acier-catalogue-cassandre.jpg]]

- an experiment between Bifur and Futura. 
- "This writing will be used mainly for the artistic direction of the magazine of the same name, as well as for certain advertisements and works of the city."
- two versions,Acier Noir, and Acier Gris

"The alphabet is usable in newspapers, it will be even more indispensable because it has been designed under a double aspect to accompany the range of shades of photogravure. With the black and white effects of zinc-treated, cooperates Acier Noir, with its bold contrast. Acier Gris, on the other hand, with its delicate hue, comes for the first time in typography to bring a harmonious complement to the greyish shades of imitation leather. All magazines and catalogues containing a photographic illustration will find in the Acier font a certain element of typographic elegance".

You can buy this typeface online, on BAT Foundry.

<hr>

**The Peignot**

![[catalogue-peignot-cassandre.jpg]]

- 1937
- bears the name of the director of the foundry Deberny et Peignot, Charles Peignot.

![[1_yVzYHcRZTFXAeYSsk-fJ_A.jpg]]
Charles Peignot

- capitals and small letters
- In typography, this assemblage is called "biform". 
- Difficult to read in small bodies
- ideal for titles or large texts. It is with this character that Paul Valéry's quotations are inscribed on the pediments of the Palais du Trocadéro.

Cassandre on the Poster:

"The poster is not, and must not be, like the painting, a work that at first glance is differentiated by its "way", a unique copy intended to satisfy the shady love of a more or less enlightened amateur salt; it must be a serial object reproduced in thousands of copies, such as a pen or an automobile, and destined just like them to render certain material services, to fulfil a commercial function. The creation of a poster poses a technical and commercial problem where the particular sensitivity has no part. It is a question of addressing the mass in a language accessible to the vulgar (...); it is a question of telling a story to the crowd.

It is in this sense that the modern poster tends to replace the minor arts, the collective arts, the anonymous arts that saw flowering Antiquity and the Middle Ages. Many well-meaning people ask me for posters "in the BUCHERON genre", as if I were free to pull galvanos indefinitely from a cliché once consecrated by public fervor! Such repetitions are impossible and would force the artist to a kind of suicide. Each poster is a new experience to try, or rather a new battle to fight, to win. Success does not wait for the one who gently cuddles the onlookers. Success is to the one who conquers the public "with the hussar" or rather, pass me this term soldier, who rapes him."

<hr>

"Painting is a goal in itself. qu’un is only a means of communication, a means of communication between the trader and the public, something like the telegraph .... We do not ask him for his opinion, we ask him to establish a clear, powerful, precise communication. But if d’expression uses the means of the painter, they cease to be for him means of individual expression, to become anonymous language, a kind of international code, the Morse alphabet of the telegrapher."

<hr>

For Cassandre:

- the poster has a purely commercial purpose, no more and no less
- Cassandre chose to be more sensitive to form than to colour, details and the order of things
- a poster must be able to blend into urban furniture, furnish facades etc.. 
- This is why his work is described as cubist, a passion for architecture that taught him to dislike "distorting particularities".

- lower case letters are only a manual distortion of monumental letters, a sort of abbreviation
- Very attached to capital letters, the use of large letters makes it possible to convey a stronger message, a message which is sure of itself and which wishes to assert itself as such.

- advocates absolute freedom in the choice of means to respond to the problem. 
- Each poster is a new battle, a real challenge.
