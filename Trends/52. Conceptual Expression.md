## Conceptual Expression: Push Pin Studio

After the 1950's the golden age of American Illustration was beginning to fade. Art Directors, through the influence of Alexey Brodovitch and others began favoring photo work over illustration. Improvements in technology allowed photo work to be as bright and bold and contraasty as had traditionally been reserved only for illustration.

However, already at the same time, in 1954, a resistance to photography as a design tool and a new direction in the conceptual/expressive nature of illustration for further the goals of the designer had taken root - most notably in the work of Seymour Chwast, Milton Glaser and Pushpin Studios.

This renewed interest in the potential of illustration carried on through the 1960's and was largely influential as part of the bridge from high modernism to pop-art and ultimately towards postmodernism.

The ideas behind Push Pin:

- individual vision of creator - expression
- embracing ornament
- embracing history through a new, modern lens (rennaissance to art nouveau)
- making new combinations
- experimenting with symbolism
- embracing the unexpected
- embracing pop attitudes
- iconic
- later on, embracing psychedelic motifs. Hip.

The group’s work had a defining influence on illustration and graphics of the time, and created some of the most recognizable commercial works of the 1960's.

The appeal of Push Pin’s graphic design work was in its witty and eclectic viewpoint compared to most graphic design firms at the time.

Decades before Postmodernism would encourage the reconsideration of past art, Chwast and Glaser had already figured out the key. Their style rejected neither commerciality nor art history, instead, combining them in a unique manner that truly hybridized past and present.

Push Pin’s original lettering became a significant part of their work, including Glaser’s “Babyteeth” typeface used on the Dylan poster.

many of the typography designed by Chwast and Glaser would become recognizable staples of the 1960s. Though typography may seem inconsequential, when one thinks of, say, an antiwar poster from the 1960s, chances are one of Push Pin’s fonts comes to mind.
