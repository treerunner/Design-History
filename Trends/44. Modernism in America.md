## Modernism in America

In the lead up to World War II, a number of European graphic artists worked in or emmigrated to the United States.

From the Bauhaus alone, notable figures like Moholy-Nagy, Gropius, Albers, Kepes, and Herbert Bayer made it to the United States in the 1930's.

<hr>

The December 1939 - January 1940 issue of PM ("An Intimate Journal for Art Directors and their Associates") can be seen as symbolic of the entry of modern design - as cultural premise and visual style - into the US.

However, as noted previously in the advancement of Moderne, or Art Deco –

"Although the philosophical basis of Herbert Bayer's undiluted European Utopianism was never absorbed or adopted by Americans, many of it's formal characteristics were. Therefore, where Bayer's Modernism was theoretical and functional, it's American counterpart was pragmatic and visual."
– Meggs

In the US, modernism was altered aesthetically, and conceptually.

In Europe there was a conviction that the design of even the simplest things should reflect some truth about the maker, making, and the reality of the times.

European modernism sought to break down traditional formal and conceptual boundaries of art and to bring making into a more direct relationship with modern life.

Many European modernists were concerned with making a functional assessment of society in order to find scientifically rational and practical ways to reform it.

European modernist designers were also propelled by the avant garde's rejection of artistic convention, by it's drive to find new ways to respond to the spirit of the times, and by its enthusiasm for the products and symbols of modernity.

Modernism did take hold in America - but with a different emphasis, and outcome.

![[30b82407-bcef-4128-8aee-cdf48f50f38f.jpg]]

American's had a view of Modernism that was affected by their experience, and European's subsequently, had a view of America as a place ripe for the Modernist experiment.

From Walter Allner (former Bauhaus student who emigrated to the US in the early 1950's):

"When Fortune magazine first appeared on European newsstands, in the early 1930's, it was considered the epitome of modernism, not for it's design as much as for it's depiction of American industry as integrated into society.""

And so - following the lead of Marcel Duchamp, Francis Picabia, and Vladimir Mayakovsky, and inspired from movies, newsreels, and magazines, many Europeans were inspired to emigrate to the US:

- Alexey Brodovitch, Russia, 1930
- Joseph Binder, Austria, 1930
- Herbert Matter Switzerland, 1936
- György Kepes, Hungary, 1937
- László Moholy-Nagy, Hungary, 1937
- Will Burtin, Germany, 1938
- Herbert Bayer, Germany, 1938
- Leo Lionni, Italy, 1939
- Ladislav Sutnar, Czechoslovakia, 1939

In the US - "styling" was the emphasis for design.

As the 20th Century progressed, between the popularity of the Art Deco style, in illustration and photography, American advertisement advanced from the presentation of largely verbal messaging to an emphasis on visual persuasiveness. Modernist styling was useful when applied to this end.

<hr>

European avant garde objects were looked at in terms of aesthetics, the complex ideology behind it was not the focus.  The focus on innovation in the Design journals of the day was completely formal - the cheerful progressivism was easily translated into pragmatic approach to domestic design problems.

Cover design from "Advertising Arts" - aninfluential graphic design trade magazine in the US from 1930 to 1935. Articles in "Advertising Arts" by characters such as Fehmy Agha, art director of Vogue, would often poke fun at avant garde ideals. The message was - ignore the ideas but use the forms.

Publications like these influenced designers and their more savvy clients

### Container Corporation of America

Walter Paepcke of the Container Corporation, for example, invested in Modernism in a big way. As can be seen by contract work with Herbert Bayer and investment in the New Bauhaus. 

Goals for the Container Corporation:

- Positive Image: benign progressive image that equated the patronage of advancved art and design with enlightened business management
- Combat anti-big-business sentiment: use of design to humanize the corporation

The goals of The Container Corporation's work with avant garde design: “to associate the company with design excellence.”

- The first campaign downplayed the company through the limited use of copy
- completely ignored the ‘rules’ of conventional print advertising
- became a critical and commercial success. 

- Campaign 1: 12 designs with AM Cassandre 1937
- Campaign 2: United Nations Series 1944
- Campaign 3: United States series 1947
- Campaign 4: Great Ideas of Western Men - 1950 - 1975, 190 designs total!

<hr>

- Brodovitch is remembered today as the art director of Harper's Bazaar for nearly a quarter of a century
- introduced a radically simplified, “modern” graphic design style forged in Europe in the 1920s from an amalgam of vanguard movements in art and design. 
- created a generation of designers sympathetic to his belief in the primacy of visual freshness and immediacy. 
- Fascinated with photography, he made it the backbone of modern magazine design, and he fostered the development of an expressionistic, almost primal style of picture-taking that became the dominant style of photographic practice in the 1950s.

- a model for the modern magazine art director. 
- took an active role in conceiving and commissioning all forms of graphic art
- specialized in discovering and showcasing young and unknown talent. 

Worked with and nurtured: 
- Irving Penn
- Leslie Gill
- Richard Avedon
- Hiro

contracted work from:

- Man Ray
- Salvador Dali
- A.M. Cassandre
- Bill Brandt
- Brasai
- Henri Cartier-Bresson
- Lisette Model
- Robert Frank. 

Starting with a splashy, sometimes overly self-conscious style largely borrowed from his early counterpart at Vogue, Dr. M.F. Agha (AIGA medalist, 1957), he gradually refined his page layouts to the point of utter simplicity.
