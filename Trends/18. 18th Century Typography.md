The Romain du Roi (French for "King's roman") was a typeface developed in France beginning in 1692. The name refers to Louis XIV who commissioned the design of the new typeface for use by the Royal Print Office.

Developed by Louis Simonneau and Phillipe Grandjean

- constructed alphabet
- created on a grid of 64 units and then further into 36 units - a total of 2304 squares
- increased contrast of thick and thin elements
- first "transitional" type

### Rococo

_adjective_

(of furniture or architecture) of or characterized by an elaborately ornamental late baroque style of decoration prevalent in 18th-century Continental Europe, with asymmetrical patterns involving motifs and scrollwork.

_noun_

the rococo style of art, decoration, or architecture.

Drawing of a typical rococo style ornament

- roughly from 1730 to 1800
- decorative excess reflected extremes in class structure
- “rock and shell garden ornamentation”
- move from structure to fluid designs
- move away from Baroque austerity
- less religious

The beginning of the end for Rococo came in the early 1760s as figures like Voltaire and Jacques-François Blondel began to voice their criticism of the superficiality and degeneracy of the art. Blondel decried the "ridiculous jumble of shells, dragons, reeds, palm-trees and plants" in contemporary interiors.

### Fournier le Jeune

**Pierre-Simon Fournier (1712-1768)**

- Rococo era
- pre-revolution
- height of ornament/"excess"
- French mid-18th century punch-cutter, typefounder and typographic theoretician.
- collector and originator of types. 
- creation of initials and ornaments
- design of letters
- standardization of type sizes
- designed typefaces: Fournier and Narcissus. 
- known for incorporating ‘decorative typographic ornaments’ into his typefaces. 
- main accomplishment: ‘created a standardized measuring system that would revolutionize the typography industry forever’.

![[FournierScale144pts 1.png]]

**Type Scale**

- 1723, the French government agreed to standards
- 1737, the younger Fournier decided to begin creating his punches to a scale of 6 ciceros or 72 points to the Paris inch, instead of the then-standard height-to-paper method. 
- This point is smaller than the subsequent Didot point established by François-Ambroise Didot 38 years later, as Fournier used the Paris foot (0.298 m) and Didot used the royal foot (pied du roi, 0.325 m). The Fournier cicero (12 points) is approximately 11 Didot points

Standardization lead to the possibility to creat a type family.

**Type Family** - separate sizes and weights for one face!

**Manuel Typographique 1764**

- by Fournier le Jeune
- Masterpiece of rococo design
- "design system" for rococo printers
- volume 1: 16 plates showing equipment and instruments used by the typefounder
- volume 2: wide-ranging collection of type specimens from different foundries

### Advancements in Engraving

- increased contrast between thick and thin was inspiring to typographers

**George Bickham the Elder (1684–1758)**

English writing master and engraver.

**Universal Penman **

1733 to 1741

A classic text in the history of writing and printing.

The best specimens of 24 of the leading calligraphers of the day. Bickham published his work in 52 separate parts, over a period of eight years from 1733 to 1741.

### Baskerville and Caslon

Up to the 1700's England was never really conducive to type innovation until...

**William Caslon**

- 1692-1766
 - English typefounder. 
 - Distinctive English flavored type
 - legibility of type
 - patronage of the leading printers of the day in England and on the continent. His typefaces transformed English type design and first established an English national typographic style.
 
 ![[1920px-A_Specimen_by_William_Caslon.jpg]]
 Caslon Old Style - 1722
 
 - Legible
 - Sturdy
 - easy on the eye
 - slightly uneven
 - but not very fashionable
  
<hr>
 

**John Baskerville** 
 
 - 1706 - 1765
 - innovator
 - businessman
 - attention to detail
 - Transitional style, inspired by Continental trends
 - printed works for the University of Cambridge in 1758
 - atheist, printed a splendid folio Bible in 1763. 
 - His typefaces were greatly admired by Benjamin Franklin, a fellow printer.  Baskerville's work was criticized by jealous competitors and soon fell out of favour,
 - since the 1920s many new fonts have been released by Linotype, Monotype, and other type foundries
 - revivals of his work and mostly called 'Baskerville'. 
 - Emigre released a popular revival of this typeface in 1996 called Mrs Eaves, named for Baskerville's wife, Sarah Eaves. Baskerville's most notable typeface Baskerville represents the peak of transitional type face and bridges the gap between Old Style and Modern type design.

**Baskerville Type**

- lightness
- elegance
- detail
- crisp
- flowing serifs

Other Baskerville innovations:

- hot pressed paper for sheen
- Rich inks
- consistency

**Paradise Lost 1758**

This edition of _Paradise Lost_, published in 1758, was Baskerville's second book. It was reprinted twice, first in 1759 and again in 1760.

![[dc0889e14463cd7a54b9f97d7b39a7b6.jpg]]

**Mrs. Eaves**

The name of this Emigre revival typeface was honored after Sarah Eaves, Baskerville’s wife and an influential woman in the history of typography. Sarah Eaves was hired as Baskerville’s housekeeper, but after her husband died, she married Baskerville and later became his helper for typesetting and printing.

### Bodoni

**Giambattista Bodoni **

- 1740-1813
- Italian typographer, type-designer, compositor, printer and publisher in Parma
- Developed the Quitenssential Modern typeface with Bodoni 

Bodoni achieved an unprecedented level of technical refinement, allowing him to faithfully reproduce letterforms with very thin "hairlines", standing in sharp contrast to the thicker lines constituting the main stems of the characters. 

He became known for his designs of pseudoclassical typefaces and highly styled editions some considered more apt "to be admired for typeface and layout, not to be studied or read." 

His printing reflected an aesthetic of plain, unadorned style, combined with purity of materials. This style attracted many admirers and imitators, surpassing the popularity of French typographers such as Philippe Grandjean and Pierre Simon Fournier.

**Bodoni Type**

- ~1780
- inspired by Baskerville
- slightly condensed underlying structure
- flat, unbracketed serifs
- extreme contrast between thick and thin strokes
- overall geometric construction
- letters made of a small subset of identical units
- "dazzling" - "sparkling"

Interchangable parts in type design - Mass Production technique (see Eli Whitney mass produced firearms around the same time)

**1818 - Manuale Tipografica**

well-designed type derived its beauty from four principles: uniformity of design, sharpness and neatness, good taste, and charm". His typefaces display an unprecedented degree of technical refinement, and epitomize purity and grace. The culmination of more than four decades of work, the Manuale tipografico represents one of history’s greatest typographical achievements.

**Didot - The other Modern Typeface**

Didot was a family type dynasty in France

http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-39691.html

- Group of typefaces named after the famous French printing and type producing Didot family. 
- modern, or Didone.
- developed in the period 1784–1811. 

Firmin Didot (1764–1836) cut the letters, and cast them as type in Paris. His brother, Pierre Didot (1760–1853) used the types in printing. His edition of La Henriade by Voltaire in 1818 is considered his masterwork. 

![[19-Didot-1819-and-Bodoni-18181.jpg]]
La Henriade by Voltaire, 1818

Like Bodoni, Didot takes inspiration from John Baskerville's experimentation with increasing stroke contrast and a more condensed armature. The Didot family's development of a high contrast typeface with an increased stress is contemporary to similar faces developed by Giambattista Bodoni in Italy.

![[82282e3349873023dbf79f776cccd4e0.jpg]]

Didot is described as neoclassical, and evocative of the Age of Enlightenment.

### Didot and Bodoni dominated printing until the late nineteenth century and still hold sway in fashion today.
