##  7000 BCE Barrier Canyon Style

Barrier Canyon Style 
- mostly in Utah
- San Rafael Swell and Canyonlands National Park
- full range extends into much of the state and western Colorado
- 1500 to 4000 years old

The term was first applied by Polly Schaafsma (The Rock Art of Utah, 1971) to describe a handful of similar sites known at the time, including several along Barrier Creek in Horseshoe Canyon (formerly known as Barrier Canyon). Barrier Canyon Style rock art panels are mostly pictographs (painted) but there are also several petroglyphs (pecked) in the style.
