## Graphic Design Systems

Technological change after WWII was significant as industry returned from war production to the manufacture of consumer goods. It was at this time that prosperity and economic development became more closely linked to large corporations - and corporate leaders understood the need to foster a culture of identity to create an image that would serve a wide and diverse audience. Design was seen as a way to shape this identity - to extend the basic idea of the trademark which had existed for centuries, into a system that would help cultivate a reputation of quality, reliability, and trustworthiness.

"A design system is a series of components that can be reused in different combinations. Design systems allow you to manage design at scale."

Examples of corporations that created corporate identity design systems:

### Olivetti

Olivetti hires Giovanni Pintori in 1936. Pintori eventually became art director in 1950. Over his time at Olivetti he worked to create an identity along the lines of Behrens AEG in Germany.

simple forms and geometries - graphic forms to represent mechanical processes.

### CBS

Under CBS president Frank Stanton, William Golden worked for two decades to unify the CBS identity - one of broadcast television's first coherent design system.

The cornerstone of the CBS identity was the eye pictograph trademark which is still in use today:

Under Golden, CBS created a unified approach to advertising and other graphics which strengthened their overall image.

The Chase logo was introduced in 1961, when the Chase National Bank and the Bank of the Manhattan Company merged to form the Chase Manhattan Bank, then the largest commercial bank in New York and the second largest in the United States.

At the time, few American corporations used abstract symbols for their identification, but we were convinced that the bank would benefit from a simple symbol that could not only unite the two newly merged corporate cultures but also come to stand in for the company’s unwieldy name. Chase Manhattan had tremendous advertising resources that could quickly establish an abstract symbol in the public mind.

Radical for its time, the Chase symbol has survived a number of subsequent mergers, and is currently the property of JPMorgan Chase & Co. It has become one of the world’s most recognizable trademarks.

Other Design Systems.

Design Systems aren't just for large corporations. They are used as part of other spatial organizations of culture:

### Publishing - MIT Press

Muriel Cooper's seven-bar graphic was simple, a geometric abstraction of the letters ‘mitp,’ driven both by Bauhaus aesthetics and new technologies.

In 1977, Massimo Vignelli designed the Unigrid System for the National Park Service. The module grid system sized at ISO A2 (16.5? × 23.4?or 420mm × 594mm) allowed the NPS to created brochures in ten basic formats and to keep a consistent, recognizable structure across all it’s materials. Not to mention how economical the system has been for them. The grid features a black bar at the top and bottom with text set in Helvetica in the header bar.

### Sports - The Olympics

By the mid 1960's the idea of the design system had become reality. No longer the space of pure innovation - many organizations sought the visual language of design systems in order to strengthen their identity and also, to use design in a big way to aid participants and spectators at large, multi-language, international events like the Olympics. Wayfinding with strong iconography coupled with design system approach is functional and effective.

Over the years, people have come to expect a strong identity for each olympics games. Each Olympics Games is a great venue for design which showcases local culture from the hosting nation, along with the usual Olympics branding.

Some memorable Olympics design systems:

**1972 - Munich - Otl Aicher**

![[1200px-Logo_München_1972.svg.png]]

in 1972, 27 years after the war and 36 years after the Olympic Games has last been held in Germany, the Federal Republic was still struggling to clean up its image. Not only did the country have to, but it also wanted to prove, almost desperately, that it was a modern, pluralistic society. “Modell Deutschland” – the “German model” – was the term coined later by the SPD Social Democratic party for its election campaign. The unflinching desire to portray a modern image to the world, and reach billions of TV spectators through the unique global exposure of ongoing Olympic coverage, gave designers free rein – a possibility they would have perhaps otherwise never had.

The key person in this endeavor was Otl Aicher, who headed the Hochschule für Gestaltung in Ulm – the Ulm School of Design. It was in this institution that the first German modern design emerged from the ravages of the war. Aicher had previously been responsible for creating mostly corporate design – Lufthansa’s C.I., for example, was his company’s brainchild. Aicher thus set off to tackle the Olympic Games project in the same manner he dealt with corporate clients.

The designer’s guiding principle was clear: “You are what you show and you show what you are.” Aicher aimed at a comprehensive approach: everything had to bear the same design – from the uniforms worn by the Olympic staff to the entire range of publicity material, including program flyers, posters and parking permits.

**Los Angeles Olympics - 1984 | Debra Valencia and Deborah Sussman**

![[1461916796.png]]

Deborah Sussmann is the designer who came up with the look and feel for the 1984 Olympics, and her bold, bright and colourful environmental design, it is said, “created an image of Los Angeles in both its modern and its post-modern forms.”
