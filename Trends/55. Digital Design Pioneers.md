- During the last quarter of the 20th Century and continuing today, digital technology and culture has advanced at a rapid rate.
- Initially, software was used to control the photo-typesetting process, with advancements in personal computing in the 1980's individuals were empowered to create and publish relatively significant work.
- Strong initial resistance to the digital workflows by many designers quickly faded.
- rapid advancements have shifted almost all design to the digital space
- Today we have unprecedented digital control of color, form, typography, space and image.

### Susan Kare

American artist and graphic designer best known for her interface elements and typeface contributions to the first Apple Macintosh from 1983 to 1986.

Susan Kare’s pictograms and fonts for the original Macintosh were revolutionary. They gave a lifeless GUI warmth and personality that lives on in the Mac and software like Adobe Photoshop to this day.

“It’s easy to forget how rudimentary the tools were. When I got to Apple at first I was still working on paper. If I got some graph paper I could make small images out of the squares and transfer those onto the computer screen.”

“Andy Herzfeld wrote an icon editor and that let you see magnified what you were working on and also as you turned the bits on and off you could see it real size. It was a huge asset that it automatically generated the hex values because before that I was taught how to look at each group of four pixels and write down each of those hexadecimal numbers. I made this one \[the bomb\] really irreverent because I was told ‘nobody will ever see this icon!’”

“Simple images can communicate with wide audiences over time. Icon design is like solving a puzzle, trying to marry an image and idea that, ideally, will be easy for people to understand and remember.”

“Bitmap graphics are like mosaics and needlepoint and other pseudo-digital art forms, all of which I had practiced before going to Apple. ‘I used to say if you like needlework, you’ll love bitmap design!’ because it really is analogous.”

“The happy Mac came from my love at 14 years old of those buttons with the smiley face. We had _permission_ to be friendly. That was part of the brief. I love to make things friendly and humane—I find that so pleasurable.”

“I was just not sure what a ‘feature’ looked like … so I was thumbing through a symbol dictionary and I came across this symbol (⌘). In the back of the book, it said it was for an ‘interesting feature’ at Swedish campgrounds. I thought it was maybe a little abstract, but it worked.”

![[6073d20983563796e6b9c9540b36289ad50c1608_1_qi9up9ajc7vh3wtz1cpsww.png]]

“Years later I went to Sweden … it was awesome to be on the ride form the airport and to see the Command key all over the place!”

### Muriel Cooper

- 1925 - 1994
- pioneering book designer, digital designer, researcher, and educator
- first design director of the MIT Press
- founder of MIT's Visible Language Workshop
- taught interactive media design as the founder and head of the Visible Language Workshop
- co-founder MIT Media Lab
- pioneer in designing and changing the landscape of electronic communication
- In 1976, her students literally broke down the wall between design and production of media, experimenting with a wide variety of new computing, electronics, and printing technologies.
- 1978, Cooper co-authored a "Books without Pages" proposal to the National Science Foundation to explore computer typography and computer workstations
- 1994 TED Talk demonstrated experiments in dynamic, interactive, computer-based typography, themes which Cooper had been exploring through much of her career

### Petr van Blokland

#### "build your own tools"

Dutch graphic designer, software author and typeface designer who lives in Delft.

- numerous important contributions to the adoption of software in typeface design
- co-author of Ikarus M, the first typeface design software for Macintosh computers.
- authored a number of typefaces, the most notable being the influential Proforma and its sibling Productus

![[Proforma.png]]
Proforma specimen

Initially designed in 1983 for Purup, a Danish company specializing in forms (hence “pro forma”), it was one of the first typefaces developed specifically for low and medium resolution output. Proforma features classic oldstyle shapes and proportions, but swellings on stems are achieved by straight lines with distinct edges. These, as well as the simple, tapered serifs, are much easier to render than the smoothly modulated curves of traditional text faces. Today, this makes Proforma especially suited for screen typography and the web.

"groundbreaking at the time for the way that it combined economy of space with good readability"

### Emigre Fonts

“People read best what they read most.”

![[Emigre19double.jpg]]
Emigre #19 - set Template Gothic by Barry Deck, 1990

- digital type foundry based in Berkeley, California
- founded in 1985 by husband-and-wife team Rudy VanderLans and Zuzana Licko
- The type foundry grew out of Emigre magazine, a publication founded by VanderLans and two Dutch friends who met in San Francisco, CA in 1984. 
- Emigre is officially spelled without accents.
- Emigre took advantage of the new medium to design digital typefaces without requiring the equipment or manufacturing infrastructure of a traditional type foundry
- Emigre Fonts was the first to sell licenses and transfer digital fonts online
- many of Emigre's fonts are considered icons of Postmodern design

<hr>

“When I started building Macintosh bitmap fonts in 1984, it was a purely experimental endeavour. I didn’t have a client for these fonts, nor did I plan to start a type foundry. It was Emigre magazine that opened up these options. Rudy had started it (with two Dutch artists) as a showcase for émigré artists. Issue #3 was the turning point for my typeface experiments and for the magazine, as it was typeset entirely using my first Lo-Res fonts. We had a lot of inquiries about the availability of these typefaces that no one had seen before. It was the start of Emigre Fonts."
– Zuzana Licko

"Most typefaces are logically systematic; if you see a few letters you can pretty much guess what the rest of the font will look like. I wanted a typeface that would willfully contradict those expectations."

**Filosofia**

"It's their Bodoni"

![[Bodoni-in-use_Emigre-Its-their-bodoni-1.jpg]]

![[Bodoni-in-use_Emigre-Its-their-bodoni-2.jpg]]

Vignelli Associates designed this “It’s Their Bodoni” announcement poster for type foundry Emigre for Zuzana Licko’s typeface Filsofia, her version of Bodoni. In 1991, Massimo Vignelli had strong words for their Emigre magazine calling it “a factory of garbage.” But when Vignelli agreed to design this poster for the company, Licko said his willingness to collaborate “reflects Emigre’s ability to bridge different approaches.”

Licko and VanderLans forged their own path, revolutionizing design aesthetics and becoming one of the most influential and innovative digital type foundries.

### Today

- We are now in a period of technological change that can be compared to the Industrial Revolution that initiated the machine age (Meggs)
- desktop computers
- Internet
- Internet of things
- social media
- have all had and continue to have an impact on culture, politics, and society worldwide

Though the tools change, the imperative of design is the same: to give order and form to ideas and expression. To Communicate.

- the newest generation, like those that preceded it, must define the directions of aesthetics and technology rather than being defined by technology.

''As creators of messages and images, graphic designers have the responsibility to contribute meaningfully to public understanding of environmental and social issues."
– Meggs, History of Graphic Design, Epilogue.
