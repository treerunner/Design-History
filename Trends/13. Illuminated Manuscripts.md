<hr>

Organized manuscript production from Late Roman to the Renaissance. 

**400 CE to ~1450 CE**

An illuminated manuscript is a manuscript in which the text is supplemented with: 

- initials, 
- borders (marginalia)
- miniature illustrations. 
- gold leaf

Created with:
- parchment
- vellum
- lampblack ink
- iron gall ink (iron sulfate with oak galls)

Any decorated or illustrated manuscript from Western traditions. (illuminated with gold leaf or not).

Costly production. Produced with care

Often sacred writings:
- Christian
- Islamic
- Jewish

Some materials travel very far, from vast trade networks.
- Lapis Lazuli from Afghanistan found in Irish manuscripts.

Codex / Codices
- invented by Romans, around 100 CE
- historical ancestor of the modern book.
- evolved from wax tablet
- sheets of vellum, papyrus, or other materials. 
- handwritten contents.

A codex much like the modern book is bound by stacking the pages and securing one set of edges in a form analogous to modern bookbinding by a variety of methods over the centuries. 

Covers were often tooled leather wrapped around boards decorated with gem stones.

Small enough to be portable. But very expensive.

Produced at the Scriptorium
- scrittori (editor and art director)
- copisti (production editor)
- illuminator (illustrator)

The scriptorium preserved classic literature (greek and latin), and religious texts.

**Classical Style**

The earliest extant substantive illuminated manuscripts are from the period 400 to 600, produced in the Kingdom of the Ostrogoths and the Eastern Roman Empire.

**Vatican Vergil ~400CE**

![[unnamed 32.jpg]]

![[VaticanVergilFol073vTrojanCouncil.jpg]]

The Vergilius Vaticanus, also known as Vatican Virgil
- Late Antique illuminated manuscript
- fragments of Virgil's Aeneid and Georgics. (Virgil = great Roman poet 70-19 BCE)
- 400 CE 
- one of the oldest surviving sources for the text of the Aeneid. 
- 76 of about 440 leaves survive

It is the oldest and one of only three ancient illustrated manuscripts of classical literature.

Similar in style to Pompeian frescoes.

Probably made for a pagan noble.

The Vatican Vergil is completely pagan.

1513: Owned by Pietro Bembo during the Renniassance (patron of printing)

**Uncials**

Uncia: Roman inch

~ 300 CE (Greek and Roman)

Uncial lettering is a modification that stems from Old Roman Cursive. There are five distinct letters that move away from a square type of writing and have curved forms. These letters are "A", "D", "E", "H", and "M"

- curved
- less strokes (compared to square capitals)
- written by hand
- Majuscule
- written with 2 guidelines

![[IMG_6009.jpg]]

Earliest known example: palimpsest fragment of Ciceros' _De Republica_ (4th century) at the Vatican Library.

**Half Uncials**

~500 CE

![[Script-Chart-2016.jpg]]

Half-uncial is one of the scripts that emerged from the New Roman Cursive. One of the most important characteristics of half-uncial is that it is now minuscule.

- miniscule
- written with 4 guidelines
- ascenders and descenders
- pen held horizontal to baseline 
- stroke contrasts, thick stems
- easy to write

![[IMG_6011.jpg]]
"Handbook of Greek and Latin Palaeography" by Thompson shows a MS of St. Hilary on the Trinity in the Archives of St. Peter's in Rome dated around 500 CE. The ascenders and descenders are clearly seen here.

![[2560px-Evolution_of_minuscule.svg.png]]

They were closely related to the uncial and half-uncial scripts, their immediate influences; the highest grade of Insular script is the majuscule Insular half-uncial, which is closely derived from Continental half-uncial script.

**Pigments**
- blue made from indigo or woad, native to northern Europe.
- Orpiment (yellow arsenic sulphide) was used to produce a vibrant yellow pigment.
- Red came from red lead or from organic sources which are difficult at present to identify.
- copper green, reacting with damp, was responsible for perforating the vellum on a number of folios. 

The artists employed a technique of adding as many as three pigments on top of a base layer.

Shortly after the Arab conquest, on the eve of the Carolingian era, a monk from Santo Toribio monastery by the name of Beatus wrote certain Commentaries on the Apocalypse that deeply affected all Europe. The copies made over the centuries, illustrated with expressive miniatures, are known today as “Beatus”.  

The magnificent Facundus Beatus (Madrid, Biblioteca Nacional, Vitr. 14-2), completed in the year 1047, is perhaps the finest example of the millenarist sentiment of this period. Commissioned by royalty, no expense was spared in its manufacture.

**Textura**

Blackletter (sometimes black letter), also known as Gothic script, Gothic minuscule, or Textura, was a script used throughout Western Europe from approximately 1150 until the 17th century. It continued to be commonly used for the Danish language until 1875, and for German, Estonian and Latvian until the 1940s. Fraktur is a notable script of this type, and sometimes the entire group of blackletter faces is incorrectly referred to as Fraktur.

The Ormesby Psalter is one of the most well-known yet mysterious manuscripts to survive the Middle Ages. It was made in a series of campaigns over many decades, starting in the late-thirteenth century, and the main decorated pages were executed in the 1310s for a marriage that never took place. Likely meant for private devotion by its wealthy patrons, this exquisite book of psalms was left unfinished.

The Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry is the most famous and possibly the best surviving example of manuscript illumination in the late phase of the International Gothic style. It is a book of hours: a collection of prayers to be said at the canonical hours. It was created between c. 1412 and 1416 for the extravagant royal bibliophile and patron John, Duke of Berry, by the Limbourg brothers.

**Limbourg Brothers**
The Limbourg brothers (Dutch: Gebroeders van Limburg; fl. 1385 – 1416) were famous Dutch miniature painters (Herman, Paul, and Johan) from the city of Nijmegen. They were active in the early 15th century in France and Burgundy

Stylistics
The Limbourg brothers had artistic freedom but worked within a framework of the religious didactic manuscript. Several artistic innovations by the Limbourg brothers can be noticed in the Très Riches Heures. In the October miniature, the study of light was momentous for Western painting (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988). People were shown reflected in the water, the earliest representation of this type of reflection known thus far. Miniature scenes had new informality, with no strong framing forms at the edges. This allowed for continuity beyond the frame of view to be vividly defined. The Limbourgs developed a more naturalistic mode of representation and developed portraiture of people and surroundings. Religious figures do not inhabit free open space and courtiers are framed by vegetation.
