## Art Nouveau

- 1890 - 1910
- Direct corollary of Art and Crafts
- Encompasses all facets of design: art, architecture, furniture, graphics, etc
- Signature feature: the organic line

Art Nouveau is a transitional style - an evolution from the historicism that dominated design for much of the 19th Century.

*"By replacing this almost servile use of past forms and styles and rejecting the anachronistic approaches of the 19th century, art nouveau became the initial phase of the modenr movement, preparing the way to the 20th century."*

A Bridge between Victorian "clutter" and modernism.

A revitalization of the design process.

An injection of fantasy, nostalgia, symbolism.

### French Symbolism

Literary influence on Art Nouveau

- 1840-1920
- a literary movement in the 19th century
- made its way into art and theater
- bridged the gap between Romanticism and Modernism 

Symbolism sought to represent absolute truths symbolically through metaphorical images and language mainly as a reaction against naturalism and realism.

In literature, the style originates with the 1857 publication of Charles Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal. 

 - focus specific moments of experience and perception; 
 - searching for their significance and a way to organize them (i.e. juxtaposition/collage). 
 - a symbol was not a specific object or idea with a concrete meaning.
 - the “interconnectedness of an image with a whole range of things or even the more cosmic interconnectedness of everything else” . 
 - Instead of clarifying, Symbolists create more overtones.
 - tone to try and approach an indescribable condition. 
 - There is a correspondence between art and the senses, reached through synesthesia.
 
*Symbolists believed that art should represent absolute truths that could only be described indirectly. *
 
 - Baudelaire : sometimes credited with coining the term modernity.
 - Mallarme
 - Verlaine

Symbolist Manifesto:
"Thus, in this art movement, representations of nature, human activities and all real life events don't stand on their own; they are rather veiled reflections of the senses pointing to archetypal meanings through their esoteric connections.""

In a nutshell, as Mallarmé wrote in a letter to his friend Henri Cazalis, 'to depict not the thing but the effect it produces'

Symbolism: a decadent reaction to retrogression and materialism.
