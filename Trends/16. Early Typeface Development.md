## Early Typeface Development

In Latin script typography, roman is one of the three main kinds of historical type, alongside blackletter and italic. Roman type was modeled from a European scribal manuscript style of the 15th century, based on the pairing of inscriptional capitals used in ancient Rome with Carolingian minuscules developed in the Holy Roman Empire.

### Old Style, ~1465

Printers and typefounders such as Nicolas Jenson and Aldus Manutius in Venice and later Robert Estienne in France codified the modern characteristics of Roman type.

- 'h' with a nearly straight right leg
- serifs on the outside of the capital 'M' and 'N'
- and 'e' with level cross stroke

1.  Bracketed serifs: thereâ€™s a curved connection between the serif and the stem of the letter.
2.  An axis drawn through the thinnest part of the round letters will lean to the left.
3.  The difference between the thin strokes and the thick strokes is not that great.

Adobe Garamond (revival of Claude Garamond's cuts (~1520-1570) which were inspired by Griffo's work)

### Transitional, ~1750

- in between "old style" and "modern" fonts
- Differences between thick and thin lines are more pronounced
- Stress is more likely to be vertical, and often the "R" has a curled tail. 
- The ends of many strokes are marked not by blunt or angled serifs but by ball terminals. 

Because the genre bridges styles, it is difficult to define where the genre starts and ends.

### Modern (Didone), ~1780

- first emerged in the late 18th century
- extreme contrast between thick and thin lines
- vertical stress
- thin serifs with a constant width, with minimal bracketing

Didone fonts are often considered to be less readable than transitional or old-style serif typefaces. Often used for display, branding, and headlines today.
