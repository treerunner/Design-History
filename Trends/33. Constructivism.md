**The Constructivist Manifesto**

- 1922
- written by Alexei Gan

https://www.moma.org/collection/works/12867

https://monoskop.org/images/e/e8/Gan_Aleksei_1922_1974_Constructivism.pdf

![[cri_000000210581.jpg]]

3 tenets of constructivism:

1. Tectonics
2. Texture
3. Construction

- Tectonics: unification of communist ideology with form
- Texture: Nature and use of materials
- Construction: creative process and search for laws of visual organization

"The material formation of the object is to be substituted for its aesthetic combination. The object is to be treated as a whole and thus will be of no discernible ‘style’ but simply a product of an industrial order like a car, an aeroplane and such like. Constructivism is a purely technical mastery and organisation of materials."

**Lisstzky’s Topography of Typography**

![[Merzissue4.jpg]]

From Kurt Schwitters collab - Merz #4 July 1923

The words on the printed surface are taken in by seeing, not by hearing.

One communicates meanings through the convention of words; meaning attains form through letters.

Economy of expression: optics not phonetics.

The design of the book-space, set according to the constraints of printing mechanics, must correspond to the tensions and pressures of content.

The design of the book-space using process blocks which issue from the new optics. 

The supernatural reality of the perfected eye.

The continuous sequence of pages: the bioscopic book.

The new book demands the new writer. Inkpot and quill-pen are dead.

The printed surface transcends space and time. The printed surface, the infinity of books, must be transcended. THE ELECTRO-LIBRARY.

<hr>

### Georgii & Vladimir Stenberg

- artists who studied engineering
- deep-rooted knowledge of the theories and methods of theatre and film-making
- prominent members of the Moscow avant-garde
