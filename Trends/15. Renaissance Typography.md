Jenson is an important figure in the early history of printing and a pivotal force in the emergence of Venice as one of the first great centers of the printing press.

Aristotle

With the Aldine Press's increasing popularity, people would come to visit the shop, interrupting Manutius's work. Manutius put up a sign that read, "Whoever you are, Aldus asks you again and again what it is you want from him. State your business briefly and then immediately go away."

- Greek classics
- Latin and Italian authors

**Collaboration with Pietro Bembo**
- Aldine launched Pietro Bembo's career as a writer by publishing De Aetna in 1496, which was the Aldine Press's first Latin publication by a contemporary author.

- Bembo later made a diagram of sins to illustrate the 1515 Aldine edition of Dante.

Manutius adopted the image of a dolphin wrapped around an anchor as his publisher's device in June 1502. The dolphin-and-anchor symbol is associated with the phrase festina lente, meaning "make haste slowly," indicating quickness combined with firmness in the execution of a great scheme. The symbol and phrase were taken from a Roman coin minted during Emperor Vespasian's reign that was given to Manutius by Pietro Bembo.

**The Hypnerotomachia Poliphili**

THE HYPEROTMACHIA OF POLIPHIO, IN WHICH  
IT IS SHOWN THAT ALL HUMAN THINGS  
ARE BUT A DREAM, AND MANY  
OTHER THINGS WORTHY  
OF KNOWLEDGE AND  
MEMORY
***
**

</center>
</pre>

The Aldine press was much too busy with its scholarly works to bother with a picture-book – with one exception. This lone exception, the *Hypnerotomachia Poliphili*, would turn out to be not only the most celebrated book design of the Renaissance, but one of the most important and yet utterly bizarre and inscrutable books ever published.

The story, attributed to the renegade Dominican friar Francesco Colonna,3 was part convoluted  *romanzo d’amore* where Poliphio searches for his unrequited love Polia in a dream; part architectural critique, echoing the the work of the humanist polymath Leon Battista Alberti; and part catalog of contemporary humanist erudition, dense with references to Ovid, Virgil and Bacchicco.

**Francesco Griffo**

Francesco Griffo (1450–1518)
- fifteenth-century Italian punchcutter
- worked for Aldus Manutius, designing typefaces
- first italic type.
- cut Roman, Greek, Hebrew and first italic type. 

Aldus gives Griffo credit in the introduction of the Virgil of 1501. However, as Manutius had achieved a monopoly on italic printing and Greek publishing with the permission of the Venetian government, he had a falling-out with Griffo. 

Griffo's typefaces have been very influential. His Romans show a degree of abstraction from calligraphy not present in the work of the earlier master Nicolas Jenson, while his italic and Greek types are notably cursive. 

Philip B. Meggs, A History of Graphic Design:
"Griffo researched pre-Caroline scripts to produce a roman type that was less artistic but more authentic than Jenson's designs".

Bembo typeface, inspired by Aldine Press:

![[bigbembo.jpg]]

Old Style:
1.  The serifs are bracketed: there’s a curved connection between the serif and the stem of the letter.
2.  An axis drawn through the thinnest part of the round letters will lean to the left.
3.  The difference between the thin strokes and the thick strokes is not that great.
