## The New Typography

"The New Typography is a simultaneous experience of vision and communication"
-Lászlo Moholy-Nagy, 1923

<hr>

- The avant-garde of the interwar period largely had a small audience, outside mainstream society. 
- But they did influence other creators / designers
- The first to distill avant garde design methodologies and disseminate to the printers, designers, typesetters of mass culture was Jan Tschichold and his "New Typography."

<hr>

### Jan Tschichold

- 1902-1974
- Son of a graphic designer and sign painter. 
- Studied at Leipzig Academy. 
- Worked at Insel Verlag as a traditional calligrapher.
- Attended first Bauhaus exhibition at Weimar in August 1923.
- Rapidly assimilated design concepts of the Bauhaus and Constructivists.

In 1925, tschichold designed a 24 page "Elementare Typographie" - an insert for the industry publication *Typographische Mitteilungen* (Typographic Impartations).

Some Influences:
Moholy-Nagy (vision / photo-montage)
Theo van Doesburg (spirit / rhythm)
El Lissitsky (constructivism)
Walter Gropius (structure / form  / function)
Herbert Bayer (typography)

<hr>

**Elementare Typographie**

- Tschichold first published his unorthodox views of typography with Elementary Typography
- appeared in a special October 1925 edition of Typographic News. 
- Like any revolutionary ideas, these perspectives caused an uproar in the design world, inspiring heated discussions.

- Gave credit where due.
- Was ultimately a revelation and generated a great deal of enthusiasm.

**The New Typography: A Handbook for Modern Designers**

- 1928
- Objective: functional design by the most straightforward means.
- Goal of typography: to deliver the message in the shortest, clearest, most efficient way possible.
- Emphasis on the nature of machine production and its impact on the design process.

![[48708ba5318ff389081f2d2bc3641455.png]]
Brochure for *The New Typography*:

- rational design
- clarity
- less decoration
- a dynamic force present in design
- kinetic, asymmetrical design
- Typography as closely related to architecture.

**The Principles of the New Typography**

"Modern man has to absorb everyday a mass of printed matter which, whether he has asked for it or not, is delivered through his letter box or confronts him everywhere out of doors. At first, today's printing differed from that of previous times less in form than in quantity. But as quantity increased the "form" also changed: the speed with which the modern consumer of printing has to absorb it means that the form of printing must also adapt itself to the conditions of modern life."

Tschichold's application of avant garde design to mass media.

- people don't necessarily read line to line but glance quickly at the whole.
- focus on the overall form of design
- in Nature and Technology, form is not independent but grows out of function
- perfection in appearance is due to precise and economic expression of function.
- Technology is not an end but a means to an end
- Focus on clarity

Old typography was about beauty. New typography is about clarity.

- old typography / central axis predominates
- central axis is pretentious
- central axis is limiting
- form is predetermined, thus inauthentic to the type being set.
- axial arrangement is illogical
- any type of "preconceived" typography is wrong

New Typography, on the other hand, develops it's form out of the functions of the text:

- pure and direct expression of the message being printed.
- emphasis on communication
- logical sequence
- every part of text relates to every other part.
- focus on rhythm of textual elements
- asymmetry allows for this rhythm
- but movement should not devolve into chaos. it must remain ordered.

- Flexible, yet standardization is possible.
- Grid vs. axis.
- Desire for an objective approach.
- Against ornamentation because ornament is not functional.
- Contrast is not necessarily ornament and can be used to impose order.
- Hierarchy can be used to express order.
- Background plays an active role in design.

**Color**

- Color is not to be used decoratively but rather functionally.
- Light is important - hence the importance of the white background.
- Red is a preferred color as it represents liveliness.
- Pure colors preferable for their intensity.

**Type**

- Type should also be as ornament free as possible.
- Sans-serif / grotesques / block letter - prererred as they best meet the spirtual demands of the times.
- sans-serifs are not a a trend but are outside of trends as they represent the barest essence of functional elements.
- Paul Renner's Futura font is a step in the right direction.

![[7349055626_d2d1dc4634_b.jpg]]

- Range of type should be restricted
- block letter / egyptian / bold fonts are preferred.
- Fraktur has little to do with current times and should be avoided.
- Sans-serif should even be used in body text, though not bold.
- Classic faces like Didot and Bodoni have a place but not as bread and butter.
- Unpretentious roman type is preferable. Sorbonne:

**Expressiveness of Type**

- Should type be expressive? Yes and No.
- Not all type has a spiritual component.
- All lettering is an expression of it's time.
- Type gets its character from the forms of it's age. It's never been about making something unique but expressing the times.
- "The type of today is an expression of clarity and truth."

<hr>

In 1933, Tschichold was arrested by Nazis. He subsequently fled to Basel Switzerland where he remained for most of the rest of his life.

### Piet Zwart

- 1885 - 1977
- Dutch Designer
- pioneer of modern typography
- Piet Zwart was influenced by Constructivism and De Stijl. 

His influence shows in his work and in this quote:

“Among the few I have indicated, is there no dynamic man of action, the rebel who will help determine the aspect of the collective expression of tomorrow? Ponder this question and know that to make beautiful creations for the sake of their aesthetic value will have no social significance tomorrow, will be non-sensical self-gratification. Every era contains the conditions for providing a rebel.”
-Piet Zwart

- Zwart worked as a designer, typographer, photographer and industrial designer in the Netherlands in the 1920s and 30s.
- NKF Company
- Created many works of graphic design before retiring from the company to spend the rest of his days as an interior and furniture designer.
