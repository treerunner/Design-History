Man Ray

American visual artist who spent most of his career in Paris. He was a significant contributor to the Dada and Surrealist movements, although his ties to each were informal. He produced major works in a variety of media but considered himself a painter above all. He was best known for his photography, and he was a renowned fashion and portrait photographer. Man Ray is also noted for his work with photograms, which he called "rayographs" in reference to himself.

1922 - Rayograph

The technique of creating photographic prints without using a camera (photograms) is as old as photography itself â€“ but emerged again in various avant-garde contexts in the early 1920s. Artist Man Ray refined and personalised the technique to such an extent that the new prints eventually carried his name 'rayographs'.
