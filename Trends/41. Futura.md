## Futura

Jan Tschichold's remarks on new typefaces for the new typography sparked the development of sans-serif typefaces that could meet the criteria for a good day to day font that was not overly ornamental.

**Universal Alphabet**

- 1925
- Herbert Bayer

Herbert Bayer's Universal alphabet was of the first in this direction of "geometric" sans serif fonts.

**Erbar**

- 1926
- Jakob Erbar

Aim was to design a printing type which would be free of all individual characteristics, possess thoroughly legible letter forms, and be a purely typographic creation. His conclusion was that this could only work if the type form was developed from a fundamental element, the circle.

**Kabel**

- 1928
- Rudolph Koch

 Rudolph Koch designed his Kabel typeface in 1928. Kabel was not quite what Tschichold had in mind:

"There is no doubt that the sans serif typefaces available today are not yet wholly satisfactory as all purpose faces.  The essential characteristics of this type have not yet been fully worked out: the lowercase letters are still too like their "humanistic" counterparts. Most of them, in particular the newest designs, such as Kabel and Ebar, are inferior to the old sans-serifs, and have modifications which place them basically in line with the rest of the "art" faces. As bread and butter they are less good than the old sans faces..."

### Futura

"...Paul Renner's Futura, however, makes a significant step in the right direction."
– Jan Tschichold

- 1927-1930
