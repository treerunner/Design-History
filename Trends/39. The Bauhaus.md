## The Bauhaus

1919 - 1933

Modernist approach to visual design education.

Erased boundaries between fine art and craft.

Goals: A unified work of art. Or Project.

Bringing art closer to life. Bringing art closer to technology.

Bauhaus: restrictive parent & naive/utopian child at the same time.

Furniture - Architecture - Graphic Design - Craft - Architecture

A Modern design aesthetic that carrys on to this day. Design as a vehicle for social change and revitalization.

Post WWI Walter Gropius - New director of Weimar Arts and Crafts School

- Had an international reputation for glass and steel architecture.

1911 Fagus Factory

![[Fagus_Gropius_Hauptgebaeude_200705_wiki_front-2.jpg]]

The Fagus Factory is one of the earliest built works of modern architecture, and the first project of Walter Gropius. The commission provided Gropius with the opportunity to put his revolutionary ideas into practice, and the stunning rectilinear volume with its primarily glazed façade would guide the course of Modernism through the coming decades.

Note: Gropius worked under Peter Behrens in a 3 year apprenticeship

Gropius emphasized the social aspect to architectural design, suggesting that improving working conditions through increased daylight, fresh air, and hygiene would lead to a greater satisfaction of workers, and therefore, increase overall production. These are the theories that would guide his design of the Fagus Factory.

Bauhaus Design - Begins with Design

Bauhaus School opened April 12, 1919.

Das Staatliche Bauhaus (the State Home for Building)

Part of a quest to reconstruct social order after the War.

Manifesto: https://bauhausmanifesto.com/

"Today, the arts exist in complacent isolation, from which they can only be salvaged by the purposeful and cooperative endeavours of all artisans. Architects, painters and sculptors must learn a new way of seeing and understanding the composite character of the building, both as a totality and in terms of its parts. Their work will then re-imbue itself with the spirit of architecture, which it lost in salon art."

"Let us strive for, conceive and create the new building of the future that will unite every discipline, architecture and sculpture and painting, and which will one day rise heavenwards from the million hands of craftsmen as a clear symbol of a new belief to come."

Roots in Fine and Applied Arts.

Art + Industry = OK

an artistically trained designer "could breathe soul into the dead product of the machine."

Bauhaus as logical next step in German integration of Art with technology and industry.

Focus on basic elements: the a/b,c's of design. Foundation in craft / making. Childhood of art. Children/primitve

![[sq-cir-tri.png]]

Geometry -> machine culture

aim to uncover the origins of visual language: basic geometry, primary color, abstraction.

Set to unleash creative impulse of students. Learning materials. Learning by experience.

- perceptual awarenes
- intellectual abilities
- emotional intelligence

Ambition towards a "point of origin"

Childhood of art -> Bauhaus as childhood of design

1923 - Itten left Bauhaus after disagreement with Gropius about approach. 

![[cri_000000011173.jpg]]

Itten: mystical / otherworldlyness
Gropius: objective approach to real world problems

<hr>

1920

Josef Albers - Master of Craft

Although Albers had studied painting, it was as a maker of stained glass that he joined the faculty of the Bauhaus in 1922, approaching his chosen medium as a component of architecture and as a stand-alone art form. The director and founder of the Bauhaus, Walter Gropius, asked him in 1923 to teach in the preliminary course 'Werklehre' of the department of design to introduce newcomers to the principles of handicrafts, because Albers came from that background and had appropriate practice and knowledge.

Aside - Albers' Interaction of Color - 1963

![[6d56be12c82b71b3bbf9f3a00556e78e-1448x1440.jpg]]

https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/08/16/interaction-of-color-josef-albers-50th-anniversary/

In Albers’s universe, color seduced, beguiled, schwindled, and these characteristics made color the most fascinating of art’s formal elements. Albers’s passion for color prompted his decision to launch what was possibly the first full-blown course in color ever given anywhere, and certainly the first based exclusively on direct observation of color’s behavior. . . . Color behaved. Color was magic.

De Stijl influence

1926: Bauhaus Magazine and Books

Disseminating Art Theory.

Much of Moholy-Nagy’s work drew influence from the futurist poets, Dadaists and the Russian Constructivists. Their use of imaginative expression embodied the idea of a unified experience of textual media with visual communication. In these avant-garde works, harsh diagonals and bold text suggest the style of contemporaneous advertisements. The futurist emphasis on youth, speed and technology reflected the changes that the Bauhaus sought to incorporate into its style. Futurist typography communicated movement and captured dynamic thought processes.

Moholy-Nagy:

"The new book production, which has to be understood on the scale of a library rather than a single volume, must and will utilize the pertinent findings of publicity and propaganda where the communication has to be measured in terms of economical effectiveness. Catalogs of merchandise, illustrated advertising, posters on billboards, front pages of tabloid newspapers, move toward inventive visual articulation."

Language of advertising.

Herbert Bayer

Artistic polymath Herbert Bayer was one of the Bauhaus’s most influential students, teachers, and proponents, advocating the integration of all arts throughout his career. Bayer began his studies as an architect in 1919 in Darmstadt. From 1921 to 1923 he attended the Bauhaus in Weimar, studying mural painting with Vasily Kandinsky and typography, creating the Universal alphabet, a typeface consisting of only lowercase letters that would become the signature font of the Bauhaus. Bayer returned to the Bauhaus from 1925 to 1928 (moving in 1926 to Dessau, its second location), working as a teacher of advertising, design, and typography, integrating photographs into graphic compositions.

Bauhaus/Bayer balanced budget by taking on work orders for industry.

Gropius: "form follows function"

Bayer / Gropius:

Clear - simple - rational forms. no serifs!

Removal of justification in typography - ragged right edge.

Visual hierarchy

Black / white / one bright hue.

open composition

implied grid

less capital letters.

contrasting type size and weight
