![[Fagus_Gropius_Hauptgebaeude_200705_wiki_front-2.jpg]]

 - early built example of modern architecture
 - first project of Walter Gropius.

Theories guiding Fagus Factory design:
- emphasis on social aspect to architectural design
- suggested that improving working conditions through increased daylight, fresh air, and hygiene would lead to a greater satisfaction of workers, and therefore, increase overall production.

### Das Staatliche Bauhaus

- Bauhaus Design - Begins with Design
- Bauhaus School opened April 12, 1919.
- Das Staatliche Bauhaus (the State Home for Building)
- Part of a quest to reconstruct social order after the War.

Manifesto: https://bauhausmanifesto.com/

"Today, the arts exist in complacent isolation, from which they can only be salvaged by the purposeful and cooperative endeavours of all artisans. Architects, painters and sculptors must learn a new way of seeing and understanding the composite character of the building, both as a totality and in terms of its parts. Their work will then re-imbue itself with the spirit of architecture, which it lost in salon art."

"Let us strive for, conceive and create the new building of the future that will unite every discipline, architecture and sculpture and painting, and which will one day rise heavenwards from the million hands of craftsmen as a clear symbol of a new belief to come."

- Roots in Fine and Applied Arts.
- Art + Industry = OK
- an artistically trained designer "could breathe soul into the dead product of the machine."
- Bauhaus as logical next step in German integration of Art with technology and industry.
- Deutsch Werkbund -> Bauhaus

- Master of Craft
- joined Bauhaus in 1922

https://medium.com/re-write/a-brief-color-study-inspired-by-josef-albers-9d6ac9614d21

"In Albers’s universe, color seduced, beguiled, schwindled, and these characteristics made color the most fascinating of art’s formal elements. Albers’s passion for color prompted his decision to launch what was possibly the first full-blown course in color ever given anywhere, and certainly the first based exclusively on direct observation of color’s behavior. . . . Color behaved. Color was magic."

"Besides surface qualities, such as rough and smooth, dull and shiny, hard and soft, textiles also includes colour, and, as the dominating element, texture, which is the result of the construction of weaves. Like any craft it may end in producing useful objects, or it may rise to the level of art.""

"The new book production, which has to be understood on the scale of a library rather than a single volume, must and will utilize the pertinent findings of publicity and propaganda where the communication has to be measured in terms of economical effectiveness. Catalogs of merchandise, illustrated advertising, posters on billboards, front pages of tabloid newspapers, move toward inventive visual articulation."
