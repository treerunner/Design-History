## The Origins of Infographics

- 1637
- Analytic geometry
- René Descartes

![[TKyga.png]]
Cartesian Plane

Descartes used algebra to solve geometry problems, formulate equations to represent lines and curves, and represent a point in space by using a system of paired numbers.

**Cartesian Coordinates**
- Descartes innovated the 2D plain with horizontal X and vertical Y axis.
- Points can be plotted on the axis with 2 numbers.
- axes can form a grid

- Left Watt's company in 1782
- silversmithing business and shop in London, which failed
- 1787 he moved to Paris
- took part in the storming of the Bastille, 1789. 
- After the French revolution, Playfair played a role in the Scioto Land sale to French settlers in the Ohio River Valley
- Returned to London in 1793
- opened a "security bank", which also failed
- 1775 - worked as a writer and pamphleteer and did some engineering work
- 1790s - Playfair informed the British government on events in France and proposed various clandestine operations to bring down the French government
- Late 1790s he was imprisoned for debt in the Fleet Prison
- released in 1802

<hr>

**Commercial and Political Atlas**

- drafted by Playfair 
- 1786
- loaded with statistical compilations
- innovative graphs and charts.

In this one book we see a number of innovations in graphical representations of information:

- Line Chart
- Bar Chart
- variations in time series line graphs
- color coding
- labeling of axis

<hr>

![[Playfair_TimeSeries.png]]
Time Series on Imports and Exports Trade Balance

<hr>

- forty-four charts and graphs on many different topics such as population, revenues, imports and exports
- data on prices, and payment balances

"Those who do not, at the first sight, understand the manner of inspecting the Charts, will read with attention the few lines of directions facing the first Chart, after which they will find all the difficulty entirely vanish, and as much information may be obtained in five minutes as would require whole days to imprint on the memory, in a lasting manner, by a table of figures."
– William Playfair

<hr>

**Statistical Breviary**

- 1801
- pie chart

![[Playfair-2.jpg]]

<hr>

![[1_r74F2r8IgbSzfjDHTqc_GA.jpg]]
Population and Revenue of the Nations of Europe

- circles represent the different European nations
- area of each circle represents the area in square miles of the nation. 
- The biggest on the left is Russia
- the green circle represents the extension in Asia
- the red circle is the extension in Europe
- Russia is followed by Turkish Empire and then all other countries back them
- The size of the Empire is splitted among Europe, Africa and Asia, making it the first pie chart to appear in history.

- two vertical axis, one on the left and one on the right. 
- The bar on the left of each bubble represents the population in the country; the bar on the right instead represents the “revenue”, 
- it is not clear if revenue is comparable to taxes collected in each country or what we call GDP today: the segment that unites the two vertical bars gives us therefore the ratio of revenue per capita.

<hr>

For Playfair, charts are effective communication tools for statistical data because “making an appeal to the eye when proportion and magnitude are concerned is the best and readiest method of conveying a distinct idea.” 

<hr>

Playfair's graphs visualized data in order to tell a specific narrative. They were also beautiful to look at.

### Charles Joseph Minard

- French civil engineer 
- recognized for his significant contribution in the field of information graphics in civil engineering and statistics
- known for representation of numerical data on geographic maps, especially his flow maps.

**Napoleon's March **

- 1869
- flow map
- made popular by Edward Tufte

![[Minard.png]]

- depiction of numerical data on a map of Napoleon's disastrous losses suffered during the Russian campaign of 1812
- Napoleon's army departing the Polish-Russian border.
- thick band illustrates the size of his army at specific geographic points during their advance and retreat
 
Displays six types of data in two dimensions:
- the number of Napoleon's troops
- the distance traveled
- temperature
- latitude and longitude
- direction of travel
- location relative to specific dates

Does not mention Napoleon. Minard's interest lay with the travails and sacrifices of the soldiers.

### Florence Nightingale

- Florence Nightingale is best known as the founder of modern nursing. 
- Champion of graphing data
- beautiful blend of Playfair’s pie chart and bar graph that we now call the Nightingale Rose chart. 
- 1858

On the surface it’s beautiful but, like Minard’s chart above, it tells a grim story. 

Engaging asymmetrical designs that make smart use of a narrative effect that some graphs provide when you create connections between each slice. You compare each slice or petal while reading around, and they blossom or shrink as the data changes.

![[050920_scivi_inline1.jpg]]

- graph shows that poor sanitation, not battle wounds, lay behind most English soldiers’ deaths during the Crimean War in the 1850s and that such deaths were avoidable.
- “provided unequivocal evidential data that preventable contagious diseases could be eliminated.”
- picture plane in a narrative. They inspire shape, color and composition with a meaning outside of traditional representation.

### W.E.B Du Bois

William Edward Burghardt Du Bois

- Born in a free Black community in Massachusetts
- 1868–1963
- African American sociologist, historian, journalist, and anti-racist activist
- sought to challenge this image of blacks being "hopeless" former slaves.

<hr>

**Exposition Universelle (the Paris International Exhibit)**


- 1900 
- DuBois organized a display of hundreds of images

Colorful infographics charting African American advancement and monochromatic photographs that presented Black lives, in labor, worship, and leisure, at school, at work, and at home.

![[08993u-copy.jpg]]

![[33873a-copy.jpg]]

- Over four months
- DuBois and his team planned, designed, and procured supporting material, including hundreds of books and pamphlets authored by Blacks
- transcribed U.S. laws restricting African Americans’ civil liberties
- statistical research about African Americans
- unique objects related to African Americans’ progress. 
- On display in Paris from April to November, the Exhibition of American Negroes (Exposition des Nègres d’Amérique) was a triumph, garnering several medals for its multimedia display of historical African American achievements and contemporaneous African American ambitions
- display was undeterred by discriminatory laws, the Ku Klux Klan’s racist terror campaign, and other forms of state-sanctioned oppression. 
- The exhibition subsequently toured to the U.S. cities of Buffalo, New York, and Charleston, South Carolina.

### Alfred H. Barr Jr.

- Art historian
- first director of the Museum of Modern art in New York
- 1936 groundbreaking show of Cubist and Abstract Art
- Barr wanted to find a way to legitimize the genre by relating the deep lineage of the art schools that he loved to the uninitiated viewer.

### ISOTYPE

**International System of TYpographic Picture Education**

- 1923 - 1971
 
Three Principals of ISOTYPE:
- Otto Neurath (Director)
- Marie Neurath (Transformer)
- Gerd Arntz (Designer)

- End of WWI brought about great social change in Europe
- New measures were needed to inform social and economic affairs, which in the newly create become everybody's concern. 
- Visual means: information, on posters and in newspapers, and statistical pages of illustrations.

**Otto Neurath**

- Worked to bring about social change in co-operative housing in Vienna. 
- The museum for Housing and Town Planning was opened in Vienna in 1924
- used charts and graphs to tell the narrative that lined up with shift in housing needs.
- Simple black and white graphs at first

With his initial success, Neurath felt that visual means of depicting information could be used to overcome confusion in the general public and at the policy level.

 The task: 
- to use one method which could always be applied
- to make the reading of the graphic representation as simple as possible
- to get to the point easily
- to make the subject interesting
- to not hide its irrelevance behind a decoratitive facade

<hr>
 
 **The Social and Economic Museum in Vienna**
 
The object was to help the general public tackle:

- the housing shortage
- amenities needed for children and mothers
- high infant mortality and tuberculosis

Neurath employed colorful charts:
- like simple puzzles anyone could solve
- problems were brought nearer to general understanding than would have been possible with just words and numbers.

Neurath had larger goals than simply focusing on Vienna.

- 1927 - Permanent exhibition room at the New Town Hall.

### The Vienna Method of Pictorial Statistics

"Each statement that does not fit without contradiction into the total structure of laws must disappear; each statement that does not rely on formulations that relate to 'data' is empty, it is metaphysics .... all statements lie on one single plane and can be combined, like all parts from a workshop that supplies machine parts."
-Otto Neurath

 ![[neurath-01.png]]
 Chart showing various means of representation approved by Neurath.
 
 "The analysis of snapshot materials - photographs, films, models, stuffed or living animals, engines - suggests the cre-ation of more and more observation statements with all their multiplicity, full of whimsicalities which may be unimportant today but important tomorrow. From these observation statements the scientist reaches his theories correlated with observation statements but distinguishable from them. Isotype aids are comparable with scientifically formulated statements."
  
 Isotype visuals: a reductive and neutral scheme of direct experience. Comparable to language but separate. An international program for direct / visual education.
  
  The attempt to eclipse interpretation with perception, to replace reading with seeing.
   
  Two important parts:
  - design of chart
  - design of pictorial symbols

In the terminology of semiotics: 
- Isotype figures are both icons and indexes
- An icon is a sign whose form is analogous to the object it represents, such as a perspective drawing or a map. 
- An index is a sign linked to its object by virtue of proximity or direct physical contact. Some examples of indexes are a footprint, an image in a mirror, or a photograph.
 
 Rules:
 - less mathematical arrangement
 - more "reading" arrangement
 - start at top, work down left to right

![[Screen Shot 2020-10-14 at 8.33.49 PM.png]]

Sometimes they would include an axis in the representation:

![[Screen Shot 2020-10-14 at 8.35.54 PM.png]]

![[Screen Shot 2020-10-14 at 8.37.00 PM.png]]

 The symbols for birth and death have been arranged in such a way that their difference comes out clearly; only their difference matters for the change in population. If surplus and deficit is the subject of a chart an axis becomes important.<hr>

By Neurath's standards:

<hr>

### Transformation

"Transformation" is the term used in Neurath's Vienna method that denotes the change in form from data to visual narrative.

"It is the responsibility of the "transformer" to understand the data, to get all necessary information from the expert, to decide what is worth trans mitting to the public, how to make it understandable, how to link it with general knowledge or with information already given in other charts. In this sense, the transformer is the trustee of the public."
- Marie Neurath

Over time, Neurath established a team: 

Director: Otto Neurath
Transformer: Marie Neurath
Artist: Gerd Arntz

Gerd Arntz joined the team as artist in 1926.

- Arntz cut symbols into linoleum blocks for use in printing. 
- Color was introduced
- Some symbols attained a "classical perfection"
- Futura was chosen as the face of Isotyoe

Isotype grew the team over the 1930's

- Moved to Holland in 1934
- downsized to core team
- Focus shifted from museum exhibits to books and publications.
- Marie and Otto escaped to England in 1940. 
- Arntz was conscripted into the German army.
- Isotype began anew in Oxford 1941.

### Isotype Symbols

With Arntz they worked toward a pictorial, reusable visual language.  A system of representation.

*Goal of unifying humanity with pictorial language.*

two central rules:
- Reduction, for determining the style of individual signs
- Consistency, for giving a group of signs the appearance of a coherent system.

**The silhouette**
- a central technique of reduction. 
- Isotype: "a rational theater of shadows."
- As a flat, simple silhouette, a pictogram reads as a sign rather than a literal depiction.
- Symbols based around the original "basic man" symbol.

Variations of basic man:
![[Screen Shot 2020-10-14 at 8.56.10 PM.png]]

sometimes symbols would be combined:

![[Screen Shot 2020-10-14 at 8.57.31 PM.png]]

Some symbols:

![[GerdArntzWebArchive.png]]

<hr>

Isotype experimented with different media:

- paper charts
- installations with magnetic charts and movable pieces
- Lantern slides

<hr>

Isotype showed social, economic statistics, and also attempted to explain complicated processes (science/industry/etc).

![[Screen Shot 2020-10-14 at 9.05.39 PM.png]]

Rousing a quick reaction is different from the aim of education. Isotype museum exhibitions were in general of an educational type and rather severe in subject matter, though colourful and attractive.

**Modern Man in the Making **

- 1939

![[modern man - elevator page.jpg]]

<hr>

"The aim of Isotype is not to translate every sentence into pictures. The aim is to present some worthwhile information, show up some relationship or development in a striking manner, to arouse interest, direct the attention and present a visual argument which stimulates the onlooker to active participation."
-Marie Neurath

Otto Neurath died in 1945 but Marie continued.

<hr>

Isotype / International 

1931 to 1934 - Russia
1936 - New York (Tuberculosis)

![[Screen Shot 2020-10-14 at 8.58.58 PM.png]]

![[Screen Shot 2020-10-14 at 9.00.30 PM.png]]

<hr>

1956 - Nigeria

![[isotype-3.png]]

Being international helped Isotype realize that the pictorial language was more geared for Western minds. Not exactly international, not exactly objective.

<hr>

**Consistency**

Consistency refers to the stylistic uniformity of a set of signs and to the standardized use of signs, allowing them to become conventional in a particular community of people. Isotype is based on a concept of universal legibility.

"The Isotype experience teaches us that consistency of visual education is possi- ble, that the same techniques of visualization can be used at all levels . . . and in all departments of scientific arguing."
-Otto Neurath

- single visual system that extended into the environment at large 
- much like Peter Behrens work in corporate identity at AEG. 
- Corporate "identity" as the visual language / grammar / vocabulary of a company or organization.

Consistency simplifies the design process and also aids the user/reader/consumer to deduce meaning when context is not exactly known. Consistency builds trust and aids understanding. When rules are established and understood - the violation of rules contains meaning.

Isotype pioneered consistency ~ but was sprawling and in some ways inconsistent.

<hr>

Isotype legacy:

- Corporate Identity
- Visual language
- Wayfinding
- Pictorial statistics
- Data visualization
- Iconography / picture language
- Pictorial education (early education)
