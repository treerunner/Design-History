## Arts & Crafts

For the most part publishing quality declined in the 1800's:
- not so well thought out type
- print inconsistencies
- cheaper material
- rush to print / quantity over quality
- poor typography
- little attention to craft or detail

There was a resistance to these trends in the form of what is known as the Arts and Crafts Movement.

- international movement
- originated in England (beginning around 1851)
- attempt to reform design and decoration in mid-19th century Britain.
- response to works seen at the Great Exhibition of 1851 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Exhibition)
- reaction against social, moral, and artistic confusion of the Industrial Revolution
- root of modern style (elements of arts and crafts inform art nouveau)
- lasted until 1920's
- return to craftsmanship
- used medieval, romantic, and folk styles of decoration
- spread as far as Japan (Mingei movement)

Term Arts & Crafts first used by T. J. Cobden-Sanderson at a meeting of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society in 1887.

### John Ruskin

Philosopher behind Arts and Crafts thinking

- leading English art critic of the Victorian era
- art patron, draughtsman, watercolourist, philosopher, prominent social thinker and philanthropist
- wrote on subjects as varied as geology, architecture, myth, ornithology, literature, education, botany and political economy
- he argued that the principal role of the artist is "truth to nature"
- critique of industrial capitalism

Ruskin's writing styles and literary forms were equally varied. He wrote essays and treatises, poetry and lectures, travel guides and manuals, letters and even a fairy tale. He also made detailed sketches and paintings of rocks, plants, birds, landscapes, architectural structures and ornamentation.

"We want one man to be always thinking, and another to be always working, and we call one a gentleman, and the other an operative; whereas the workman ought often to be thinking, and the thinker often to be working, and both should be gentlemen, in the best sense. As it is, we make both ungentle, the one envying, the other despising, his brother; and the mass of society is made up of morbid thinkers and miserable workers. Now it is only by labour that thought can be made healthy, and only by thought that labour can be made happy, and the two cannot be separated with impunity."
— John Ruskin, *The Stones of Venice vol. II*: Cook and Wedderburn 10.201.

"There is no wealth but life. Life, including all its powers of love, of joy, and of admiration. That country is the richest which nourishes the greatest number of noble and happy human beings; that man is richest who, having perfected the functions of his own life to the utmost, has always the widest helpful influence, both personal, and by means of his possessions, over the lives of others.
—  John Ruskin, *Unto This Last*: Cook and Wedderburn, 17.105"

### Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood

![[1024px-Dante_Gabriel_Rossetti_-_Proserpine_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg]]
Proserpine, 1874, by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, portrayed by Jane Morris

<hr>

- sought a return to the abundant detail, intense colours and complex compositions of Quattrocento Italian art
- rejected what they regarded as the mechanistic approach first adopted by Mannerist artists who succeeded Raphael and Michelangelo.
- believed the Classical poses and elegant compositions of Raphael in particular had been a corrupting influence on the academic teaching of art, hence the name "Pre-Raphaelite". 
- objected to the influence of Sir Joshua Reynolds, founder of the English Royal Academy of Arts, whom they called "Sir Sloshua". 
- "sloshy" meant "anything lax or scamped in the process of painting, any thing or person of a commonplace or conventional kind. 
- associated their work with John Ruskin, an English critic whose influences were driven by his religious background.

Circe Invidiosa 1892 John William Waterhouse 

<hr>

The myth of Circe, Glaucus, and Scylla originates in Book XIV of Ovid's Metamorphoses. The specific scene that Waterhouse bases this painting on occurs in lines 52–65 of the epic poem:

There was a cove,
a little inlet shaped like a bent bow,
a quiet place where Scylla, at midday,
sought shelter when the sea and sky were hot;
and, in midcourse, the sun scorched with full force,
reducing shadows to a narrow thread.
And Circe now contaminates this bay,
polluting it with noxious poisons; there
she scatters venom drawn from dreadful roots
and, three-times-nine times, murmurs an obscure
and tangled maze of words, a labyrinth—
the magic chant that issues from her lips.
Then Scylla comes; no sooner has she plunged
waist-deep into the water than she sees,
around her hips, the horrid barking shapes.

William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones discovered and developed a love for Chaucer as undergraduates at Oxford University. After Morris established the Kelmscott Press in 1891, the two old friends agreed that The Canterbury Tales and other works by Chaucer would be a major goal for the enterprise. Morris spent four years working on the book. Trial pages were printed in 1892, while final production began on August 8, 1894. The first two copies of the book were delivered to Morris and Burne-Jones on June 2, 1896. Morris was already in failing health; he died four months later on October 3, 1896.
