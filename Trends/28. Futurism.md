### Filippo Tommaso Marinetti

- 1876 – 1944
- Italian poet, editor, art theorist, and founder of the Futurist movement
- associated with the utopian and Symbolist artistic and literary community Abbaye de Créteil between 1907 and 1908
- best known as the author of the first Futurist Manifesto, which was written and published in 1909.

Italian poet Marinetti publishes his Futurist Manifesto in 1909 in Paris newspaper, Le Figaro:

“We intend to sing the love of danger, the habit of energy and fearlessness,” wrote the poet. “We affirm that the world’s magnificence has been enriched by a new beauty: the beauty of speed. A racing car whose hood is adorned with great pipes, like serpents of explosive breath - a roaring car that seems to ride on grapeshot is more beautiful than the Victory of Samothrace. We will glorify war - the world’s only hygiene - militarism, patriotism, the destructive gesture of freedom-bringers, beautiful ideas worth dying for, and scorn for woman.”

"We will destroy museums, libraries, and fight against moralism, feminism, and all utilitarian cowardice."

Futurism and typography made for an explosive combination.
