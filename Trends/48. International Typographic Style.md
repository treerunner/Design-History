### "Swiss Style"

International Typographic style has it's roots, not in Germany but Switzerland. The movement began post WWII, in the 1950's, and spread through much of europe rather quickly. Most of the original designers adhered to this style for the first two decades of it's existence, but adherents exist even today. 

Features of the International Style:

- Objective *clarity*
- Academic
- Unity of design through asymetric construction
- mathematically constructed grid
- objective use of photography
- clear information design
- pragmatic
- clean
- straight forward, minimal use of exaggeration or propaganda

The visual appearance of International Style reflects an attitude or worldview.

Design as socially useful vs. design as individual expression.

Designers: objective conduits along similar lines to the larger project of the "constructor."

International Style has it's roots in the curriculum of the School of Design, Basel. Founding course had exercises on simple fundamental geometry with cube and line. This was developed and existed independently of the Bauhaus. The vorkurs lasted from 1908 to the 1950's.

International style alas has a large component of De Stijl inspiration.

### Ernst Keller

- 1891 - 1968
- Ernst Keller is referred to as the "father" of Swiss Style, later International Typographic Style. 
- large number of Keller's students later shaped this Swiss Style and made it famous. 
- Keller trained originally as a lithographer.
- Keller is known primarily as a teacher
- Took a teaching position in 1918 at the Zurich Kunstgwerbeschule (Ad layout)
- Also known for poster designs and his work on lettering and graphic design in architecture
- Ernst Keller’s contribution to the development of innovative, non-academic didactic principles in design training plays a fundamental role. 
- His teaching activity starting in 1918 can be defined as one of the first systematic training programs for graphic design in the world.
- His many years of teaching between 1918 and 1956 resulted in very different designers. 
- Students include the protagonists of new graphic design: Richard Paul Lohse, Josef Müller-Brockmann and Carlo Vivarelli among others.

- During a renovation of the Zurich University of the Arts in 2001, the original letterings were discovered hidden behind some wallpaper. 
- With students, Rudolf Barmettler traced parts of the characters, refining and fully redrawing them in ink. 
- In 2002, while teaching at the F+F Design School, Barmettler, together with his students, created additional weights. 
- Reinhard Haus then helped to digitise the drawings and extend the fonts using ‘Fontographer’. 
- Since 2014 Rudolf Barmettler and Anton Studer have reworked the entire concept and every detail of the typeface to make it more than just another historical remake.

**Keller's emphasis:**

- symbology
- simple geometry

- Ballmer left the Bauhaus in 1930, motivated by his left-leaning political beliefs.
- Ballmer is best known for his political poster designs, produced directly after his departure from the school.
- works are characterized by their use of red and black linocut silhouettes and leftist messages
- In 1931, Ballmer joined the faculty of the Allgemeine Gewerbeschule Basel, where he taught photography and design
- Ballmer remained associated with the school until his death in 1965. 
- After 1930, Ballmer additionally worked for a number of corporate clients; among the work he produced in this capacity is the logo for the Basel municipal authority.

The work produced by the two designers in this period proved foundational to the later emergence of the International Typographic Style.

<hr>

- Bill is widely considered the biggest influence on Swiss graphic design beginning in the 1950s
- theoretical writing and progressive work. 
- His connection to the days of the Modern Movement (Bauhaus) gave him special authority. 
- As an industrial designer, his work is characterized by a clarity of design and precise proportions. 

"It has become clear to us that beauty can no longer be developed out of function alone; instead, the demand for beauty has to be set on the same level as a functional demand since it is a function too."
– Max Bill

**Ulmer Hocker**

Ulm Stool

![[MaxBillUlmStool.jpg]]

- 1954
- notable product design
- a stool
- a shelf element
- a speaker's desk
- a tablet or a side table. 

Although the stool was a creation of Bill and Ulm school designer Hans Gugelot, it is often called "Bill Hocker" because the first sketch on a cocktail napkin was Bill's work.

![[1511_5.8c_ulm2123_foto_c.jpg]]

<hr>

- Bill sought to create forms which visually represent the New Physics of the early 20th century
- He sought to create objects so that the new science of form could be understood by the senses: that is as a concrete art
- Bill is not a rationalist – as is typically thought – but rather a phenomenologist. One who understands embodiment as the ultimate expression of a concrete art. In this way he is not so much extending as re-interpreting Bauhaus theory.

- Zurich graphic designer from 1929-1937
- 1937 moved to Stutgart Germany
- worked on the possibility of describing actions and forces through abstract compositions

- The theorization of these ideas was summarized in his publication “How to illustrate invisible processes in graphic design“.
- subtly composed colors’ shapes and lines to achieve bold and effective images
- extreme economy of means
- every sign is completely necessary to the final expression
- extreme formal rigor is combined with a never-ending experimentation with media and compositions, leading to solutions which are functional and poetic at the same time.
- photomontage / collage
- Visual pattern / form
- Wide ranging experimentation in form / color / shape > into his designs.
- mastery of constructivist design with experimentation and curiosity.
