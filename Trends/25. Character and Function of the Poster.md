BC it was probably still possible to read and study them, at the time of Plutarch small fragments were still in existence.

From "The History of the Poster"

Josef and Shizuko Müller-Brockmann classify the history of the poster into 4 types:

1. **The Illustrative Poster**

Designs represent situations, people, or objects shown by straightforward graphic or photographic means.

2. **The Objective-informative Poster**

Impart factual information in as objective manner as possible. Designs tend to supress subjective artistic "feelings," an almost anonymous expression is typical.

3. **The Constructive Poster**

The basis of the constructive poster is the principal of arrangement. A harmonious ratio between the whole design and its constituent parts. The 'structural' predominates.

4. **The Experimental Poster**

Always surprises. Ahead of its time. Forms appear strange at first because they do not belong to the form vernacular of the time.
