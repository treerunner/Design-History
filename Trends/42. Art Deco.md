Jean Carlu, 1935

<hr>

Modernist designers and artists initially struggled to influence society with their ideas of function and fitness.

"Moderne," or "modernistic" design - an amalgam of new reductive forms with old decorative tendencies was much more palatable. And popular worldwide.

Broadly, this infusion of simple modern forms on to "jazz-age" sensibilities, is known as "Art Deco."

Art Deco is a *popular* style.
 - not a movement

Art Deco styling affected:
- architecture
- furniture
- clothing
- graphic arts

Art Deco existed in the interwar period, between WWI and WWII. 1920's to 1939.

As Art Nouveau waned, designers in the Societé des Artistes Décorateurs realized that the middle class needed something to fill in - a furthering of the progression.

- Easy to consume
- nonthreatening
- accessible
- Modern-*istic*

Art Deco was not retrogressive, but responsive to the desires of the consumer. 

- People still wanted ornament.

Art Deco sampled from:

- Cubism (form)
- Futurism (motion)
- Bauhaus (basics)
- Constructivism (composition), etc.

Art Deco is often:

- geometric
- organic
- rectilinear
- colonial / orientalist
- symbolism from other cultures & history
- symbolism from industry / machines

Art Deco re-emphasizes the end of traditional design. But founded on mania for newness.

 - concrete forms
 
*In spite of Melkinov and Le Corbusier, the 1925 exhbit was ultimately a triumph of Moderne over Modern, design linked to art, not the machine.*
 
 The 1925 Paris Exhbition fanned the flames of Art Deco around the world.

### Art Deco

As a pure style, without much ideology behind it, Art Deco could be applied to any subject or theme. And it was.

Art Deco was also non-partisan: 

- equally applied by socialists, fascists, capitalists.

Futuristic visual language could be easily applied to travel, communication, product design.

Moderne forms in Art Deco also evolved out of directions in scientific and industrial progress:

- ray bands
- streamline forms
- motion
- aerodynamics

The Art Deco era was also book-ended at the 1939 World's Fair in New York - a time that also marks its end as a result of a genuine need to remove ornament to make way for wartime austerity at the beginning of WWII.

<hr>

### French Art Deco

Art Deco in France very much continued where Art Nouveau left off.

- new ornamental styling.
- Cubist tendencies.

### German Art Deco

The question of style was very important in Germany through the first half of the 20th century. Germany was also at a crossroads between expressionism, constructivism, de stijl, futurism, and pictorial modernism. Bauhaus geometries and expressionistic gestures met in Germany's take on Art Deco.

### Italian Art Deco

- Most of the Italian pavilion at the 1925 Exposition was a look back through Italy's rich history of art, architecture, and design. 
- There was a small corner of futurist work from Balla, Boccioni, and Depero
- Italian decorative art between the wars was an odd mash-up of classical and modernist forms. 
- Futurism lost steam when adopted by Mussolini as an accepted style and propaganda tool. 

Nonetheless, Italian Art Deco was infused with Futurist styling.

- Mussolini referred to designers as "architects" - useful tool of his party. (constructivist model for activating propaganda?)

### Art Deco England

- early 1920's English design emerged from Victorian era ornamentation
- functional modernism consistent with the needs of industry. 
- Britain had become a model for industrial production. 
- E McKnight Kauffer experimented with integrating Cubist inspired forms in his design work. 

"The contemporary style has evolved out of the harsh artistic puritanism of a Cubism which in its first violent reaction against prettiness, would suffer nothing but straight lines and angles, into something more ripe and humane, for which there is yet no convenient name."
- Aldous Huxley (1930)

### American Art Deco

"From the chaotic situation arising out of an era of prosperity without precedent for decoration, produced by Expo '25 ... a style emerged ..or, better still, .. a common denominator - the modern style.'"
– Interior designer Donald Deskey, 1933

- self-styled designers 
- play with basic form 
- ornamenting circles, zig-zags, triangle, curving lines. 
- Much work was badly applied but there are a number of gems.
- Art Deco was the style of the age - but also the scourge.
