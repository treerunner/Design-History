## Cubism

Art outside of the natural. A focus on geometry and spatial relations. 

- revolutionary new approach to representing reality
- Began 1907–08 by artists Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque
- different views of subjects (usually objects or figures) together in the same picture, resulting in paintings that appear fragmented or abstracted

### A painter should "treat nature in terms of the cylinder, the sphere, and the cone."
– Paul Cézanne

Post WWI Leger moves toward a more populist and accessible style. 

"...I was stunned by the sight of the breech of a 75 millimeter in the sunlight. It was the magic of light on the white metal. That's all it took for me to forget the abstract art of 1912–1913. The crudeness, variety, humor, and downright perfection of certain men around me, their precise sense of utilitarian reality and its application in the midst of the life-and-death drama we were in ... made me want to paint in slang with all its color and mobility"
