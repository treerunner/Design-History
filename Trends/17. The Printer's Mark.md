## The Printer's Mark

A printer's mark, device, emblem or insignia is a symbol that was used as a trademark by early printers starting in the 15th century.

**Johann Fust & Peter Schöffer, 1459**

- The Mainz Psalter
-  Colophon included printer's mark
- two heraldic shields suspended from a branch. 
- The shields bear a saltire (a diagonal cross) and a chevron surrounded by three stars. Perhaps these are based on Fust and Schoeffer’s individual coats of arms

**Simon de Colines, Paris, 1520-1527**

…the old [French word for] rabbit is ‘conil’, an acoustic anagram for Colines. Bouquin, a good French farmer’s word for a male hare or rabbit, is also urban slang for book, especially a book that is old and worn. The book-hawkers of Paris are bouqinistes, jack-rabbit dealers.
Kay Amert (2012), p. 17.
