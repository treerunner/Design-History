## Emory Douglas: Visualizing Revolution

“Most popular media represents middle to upper class people as ‘normal’. Douglas was the Norman Rockwell of the ghetto, concentrating on the poor and oppressed. Departing from the WPA/social realist style of portraying poor people, which can be perceived as voyeuristic and patronizing, Emory Douglas’s energetic drawings showed respect and affection. He maintained poor people’s dignity while graphically illustrating harsh situations.” 
— Colette Gaiter, Visualizing a Revolution

“In the ’50s and ’60s there was segregation here in the Bay Area and all over the country. There was a curfew for young blacks my age in the Fillmore district where I lived. It was a disturbing thing. There were civil rights movements here in San Francisco. They would show on the national news the dogs being sicced on the marchers, being sprayed with the hoses, being beaten with the batons.”

### The Black Panther

- weekly issues
- “Black Community News Service”
- shined a light on the Black struggle
- educated and organized the community
- promoted the party’s platform, the Ten-Point Program
- The Ten-Point Program demanded full employment, decent housing, education, and health care
- news stories and critical essays from party leaders
- Douglas’s graphical contribution, in the form of cartoons, collages, and a full-page illustration on each back cover, that struck a chord with the broadest audience.

“At that time the African American community was not a large reading community. They learned from observation and participation. So we had a lot of visuals that they could identify with. Photographs and short captions, as opposed to long, drawn-out essays and editorials. They were visual interpretations of the conditions people lived in. Inner cities, poor communities. Combined with revolutionary imagery. The people saw themselves in the artwork. They became the heroes. They could see their uncles in it. They could see their fathers or their brothers and sisters in the art.”

- Douglas's visual language depicted those who abused their power as pigs and rats
- black people were shown as proud revolutionaries, defending their right to exist
- the objective was to convey the party’s belief in organized armed resistance as part of the solution to oppression.
- initially seen (from outside) as overly militant. 

“They believed in self-defense, which is a constitutional right — the Second Amendment of the Constitution gave me the right to bear arms. And they carried that out in an organized manner, a very disciplined and very organized manner. And that was the first phase of the Black Panther Party. But there’s also the phase of dealing with the social programs, the political solidarity, … and international politics as well. It was an organization for human rights.”
— Emory Douglas, interview with The Real News Network

<hr>

- spring of 1971, the Black Panther Party’s message shifted from armed self-defense to community organizing
- Douglas’s more brutal graphics gave way to images of information, and even celebration
- Douglas’s covers and posters promoted the Panthers’s political activities and social programs:
 
- health clinics
- schools
- arts events
- Free Breakfasts for Children which soon spread across the US, feeding over 10,000 kids every morning and serving as a model for lunch programs in public schools.

- The Black Panther peaked from 1968 to 1971
- the most widely read Black newspaper in the United States
- among the most widely distributed publications of any kind, reaching a peak weekly circulation of more than 300,000, rivaling the major newspapers of most US cities. 
- It was eventually distributed internationally, with multiple centers in the US, anchored by the main center in San Francisco. 
- All in spite of the FBI’s continued efforts to shut down the paper and the party
- lawyers had to accompany the deliveries from the press to the airport.

**Production Methods:**

“Initially, wherever we were set up, usually someone’s home, that would be our production area. We used regular tables, regular lights, Elmer’s glue, rubber cement. We cut and pasted. We made up our own layout sheets. Non-repro blue markers. A lot of it was done on an IBM Selectric typewriter. We knew some folks in the publishing business, so every now and then we could get them to typeset the galleys. But we used pre-fabricated instant type that came on sheets from Formatt a Letraset alternative. It was economical, but it was also the best one because it had a line underneath the alphabet so you could set words without having to rub the letters off.”

![[pattern-EmoryDouglas-20179044.jpg]]

- limitations of the production defined the visual style of the paper 
- Thick marker lines of his woodcut-inspired drawings were not only graphically appealing, they also masked the imperfect registration of the newspaper press
- Transfer film tints and patterns not only added texture and were an effective, low-cost alternative to multicolor printing. 
- Most issues of the paper were one-color (black) or two-color (black plus one color).

“It was on-the-job training. We had to evolve as we went along. I had the theory, and some of the practice from going to various jobs when I was at City College, but then you had to apply that to the reality of being in charge of the production of the paper. What also helped was having the experience of working at community print shops, where you had to do high-end jobs without high-end equipment. They knew how to cut the corners and get the jobs done.”

“Today the actual organization doesn’t exist, but it left a blueprint for people to be inspired by. The social program, being able to use my art to enlighten, and to inform, and educate – all that is part of the legacy. Art has relevancy, whether it’s to exploit you, or pacify you, or to enlighten you and inform you. It’s a legacy. That’s the power of it.”
