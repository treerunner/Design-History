### Der Blaue Reiter 

- 1911
- group of artists united in rejection of the Neue Künstlervereinigung München (Munich New Association of Artists) in Munich, Germany
- founded by a number of Russian emigrants, including Wassily Kandinsky, Alexej von Jawlensky, Marianne von Werefkin, and native German artists, such as Franz Marc, Paul Klee, August Macke and Gabriele Münter
- considered that the principles of the Neue Künstlervereinigung München, a group Kandinsky had founded in 1909, had become too strict and traditional.

- The artists shared a common desire to express spiritual truths through their art.
- blue is the colour of spirituality: the darker the blue, the more it awakens human desire for the eternal

Kandinsky - Impression III (Concert) - 1911

"The deeper the blue becomes, the more strongly it calls man towards the infinite, awakening in him a desire for the pure and, finally, for the supernatural... The brighter it becomes, the more it loses its sound, until it turns into silent stillness and becomes white."

### Concerning the Spirtual in Art

- 1910
- book detailing Kandinsky's views on "the spiritual turning-point" of art and society
- psychology of color
- colors as “vibrations of the soul”
- interrelation of forms
- anticipates the emergence of abstract art as the purest form of influence on the human soul
- foretelling the upcoming emergence of an epoch of great spirituality

"In his or her turn, the work of the viewer is to find within him- or herself the purity of perception, which, at this level, does not relate to the beauty of nature. The ideal imitation of nature as the summit point of artistic mastery has remained in the past. The impressions of impressionists, the emotions of expressionists, the experiments of cubists - all these stages have long been passed, and now the task of the viewer is to see the beauty of pure color and pure shape."

"The spiritual life, to which art belongs and of which she is one of the mightiest elements, is a complicated but definite and easily definable movement forwards and upwards. This movement is the movement of experience. It may take different forms, but it holds at bottom to the same inner thought and purpose."
