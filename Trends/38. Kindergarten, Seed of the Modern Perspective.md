<hr>

The Kindergarten system of formalized education for young children was developed in Germany by Freidrich Froebel in the firat half of the 19th century.

- 1837 
- Friedrich Froebel founded his own school and called it "kindergarten," or the children's garden.  
- "self-activity"
- teacher as guide, not lecturer
- emphasis on action and direct observation
- hired women as instructors rather than men
- 1850 formalized throughout Germany
- 1875 introduced to the United States
  
Prior to Froebel's kindergarten, children under the age of 7 did not attend school. It was believed that young children did not have the ability to focus or to develop cognitive and emotional skills before this age.

". . . because learning begins when consciousness erupts, education must also."
– Froebel

Kindergarten was one of many advancements that paved the way to modernism:

- democratic (in)stability
- psychosexual emancipation
- machine age
- Cézanne's paintings
- African sculpture
- Cubism
- Futurism
- Dada

One thing that ties all the above together: kindergarten.

- international force for change
- radical educational system
- catalyst in exploding cultural past
- restructuring worldviews
- the seed and literally the childhood of the modern era.

Kindergarten: 
- children's garden (organizational model)
- garden of children (spiritual foundation)

### Friedrich Froebel

- 1782 - 1852
- laid the foundation for modern education based on the recognition that children have unique needs and capabilities.
- began as educator in 1805 in Frankfurt
- Worked with Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi in Switzerland

<hr>

Pastalozzi's concept of *Anschauung*:

"things before words, concrete before abstract."
– Pestalozzi

- form before nomenclature
- line and simple geometric shapes as building blocks of the actual universe

<hr>

### Crystals

![[crystals.png]]

Froebel believed that "spritual unity," the proper subject of human education was manifest in the laws of nature.

Froebel immersed himself in 
- physics
- chemistry
- minerology
- natural history

- 1814: Froebel worked at the Mineralogical Museum of the University of Berlin classifying crystals.

![[a-crystal-study.jpg]]

For Froebel:
Shapes of crystals, outcomes of triangles, squares, cubes, – are the outcome of the same natural laws that result in the growth of children, people, entire societies. Handling an manipulating these forms correctly would reveal and illuminate the logic of creation.

- intersection of nature and education into a cohesive direction

### Gifts

![[froebel-gift-milton-bradley_1_2c1574570b4e9230d6283a3f20f009c4-1.jpg]]

In Froebel's system, children would spend half of the day engaged in handicrafts:
- woodworking
- weaving
- bookbinding
- gardening

- A means to gratify a student's innate desire for creative and useful education.
- material of the kindergarten was referred to as "gifts"
- objects not new but the way they were approached was radical

"The gift gived the child a new cosmos, the occupation fixes the impressions made by the gift. The gift invites only arranging activities; the occupation invites also controlling, modifying, transforming, creating activities. The gift leads to discovery; the occupation to invention. The gift gives insight; the occupation, power "

- Gifts as a series
- each gift foreshadows the one succeeding it
- solid to plane to line to point
- then reversed
- then to 3D space with peas and sticks and clay

Gifts deconstructed all physical and conceptual realms and conveyed a vivid impression of continuity of nature.

- forms of nature (life)
- forms of knowledge (science)
- forms of beauty (art)

<hr>

**Gift 1: Ball**

![[FR-02.jpg]]

- catalyst for first learning experience
- "in the first plays with the ball, the life of the child makes itself known, and the outer world makes itself known to the child in unity."

<hr>

**Gift 2: Sphere, Cylinder, Cube**

Thesis / antithesis / synthesis

![[76703f796bb21b1b67614fa7f929fa56.png]]

- sphere and cube are opposites
- law of opposites
- instability and resolution
- objectified abstraction of unity between disparate things: cylinder contains a sphere, cube contains a cylinder
- demonstrates universal interconnectedness
- represents essence of kindergarten
